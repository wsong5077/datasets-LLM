https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gulf_Stream_(painting),The Gulf Stream (painting),"The Gulf Stream is an 1899 oil painting by Winslow Homer.[1] It shows a man in a small dismasted rudderless fishing boat struggling against the waves of the sea, and was the artist's statement on a theme that had interested him for more than a decade.[2][3] Homer vacationed often in Florida, Cuba, and the Caribbean.
 Homer crossed the Gulf Stream numerous times; his first trip to the Caribbean in 1885 seems to have inspired several related works dated from the same year, including a pencil drawing of a dismasted boat, a large watercolor The Derelict (Sharks), and a larger watercolor of the forward part of the boat, Study for ""The Gulfstream"".[4] A later watercolor study was The Gulfstream of 1889, in which the disabled boat now includes a sailor and flailing shark. Additionally, there are other related watercolors; the shark in Shark Fishing of 1885 was later appropriated for The Gulfstream of 1889,[5] and a watercolor of 1899 entitled After the Hurricane  (also known as, After the Hurricane, Bahamas), in which a figure lies unconscious beside his beached boat, with waves and sky suggesting the aftermath of a storm, represents the finale of the watercolor narrative of man against nature.[6]
 Another possible inspiration for the series of watercolors and The Gulf Stream itself was McCabe's Curse, a Bahamian tale about a British Captain McCabe who in 1814 was robbed by thieves, hired a small boat in hopes of reaching a nearby island, but was caught in a storm and later died in Nassau of yellow fever; Homer saved an account of the story and pasted it into a travel guide.[5]
 A visit to Nassau and Florida between December 1898 and February 1899 immediately preceded the final painting.[8] Homer began work on the painting by September 1899, at which time he wrote: ""I painted in water colors three months last winter at Nassau, & have now just commenced arranging a picture from some of the studies.""[9] Chronologically the first of a series of major works painted by Homer in the last decade of his life, The Gulf Stream was painted in the penultimate year of the century, the year after the death of his father, and has been seen as revealing his sense of abandonment or vulnerability.[8]
 In 1900, Homer sent The Gulf Stream to Philadelphia to be exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, after it was returned later that year he wrote ""I have painted on the picture since it was in Philadelphia and improved it very much (more of the Deep Sea water than before).""[10] In fact, comparison with an early photograph of the painting shows that Homer not only reworked the ocean, but changed the starboard gunwale by breaking it, added the sail and the red dash of color near the waterline, made the boat's name (Anna – Key West) clearly legible, and painted in the ship at the upper left horizon[10]—possibly to mitigate the sense of desolation in the work. He then showed the painting at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, and asked $4,000 for it.[10]
 In 1906, The Gulf Stream was exhibited at the National Academy of Design, and all the members of the academy's jury petitioned the Metropolitan Museum of Art to purchase the painting.[11] Newspaper reviews of the work were mixed;[11] it was seen as more melodramatic than Homer's usual work. A reviewer in Philadelphia noted that viewers had laughed at the painting, which he referred to as ""Smiling Sharks"", describing the scene as ""a naked negro lying in a boat while a school of sharks [are] waltzing around him in the most ludicrous manner"". Another contemporary critic wrote that The Gulf Stream ""displays a certain diffusion of interest seldom seen in the canvases of [Homer's] best manner"".[12] The museum bought the painting the same year.
 Homer's intentions for The Gulf Stream are opaque. The painting has been described as ""a particularly enigmatic and tantalizing episode, a marine puzzle that floats forever in a region of unsolved mysteries.""[13] Bryson Burroughs, a onetime curator at the Metropolitan Museum, noted that it ""assumes the proportion of a great allegory if one chooses"".[14] Its drama is of a romantic and heroic vein, the man stoically resigned to fate, surrounded by anecdotal detail reminiscent of Homer's early illustrative works.[10]
 When a viewer requested an explanation for the narrative, Homer fairly bristled in response:
 I regret very much that I have painted a picture that requires any description....I have crossed the Gulf Stream ten times & I should know something about it. The boat & sharks are outside matters of very little consequence. They have been blown out to sea by a hurricane. You can tell these ladies that the unfortunate negro who now is so dazed & parboiled, will be rescued & returned to his friends and home, & ever after live happily.[15][16] The painting alludes to John Singleton Copley's 1778 composition, Watson and the Shark, as well as a handful of dramatic marine paintings of the 19th century.[8] In American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America, Robert Hughes contrasts Homer's picture with Copley's. While Copley's shark jaw is alien in form and most likely drawn from second-hand accounts, Homer's—owing to the artist's familiarity with the subject—correctly captures the sharks' anatomy. Secondly, in Copley's version, a rescue is imminent: the horizon is near and light in tone, and many boats, within the harbor and probably docked, are seen in the background. Homer's version, with its circling sharks, broken mast, lone figure, looming water spout, and open sea give a sense of abandonment. The ship at far left is so distant as to suggest that society, while present, is completely unattainable; it presents the viewer with a so-close-yet-so-far situation. These two paintings contrast in their immediacy as well.  In Watson and the Shark there is constant movement:  the boat moving forward, the downward thrust of the spear, the two men reaching down for the victim, and finally the shark which extends off the canvas.  In Homer's painting, the scene is more static:  the sharks seem to swim slowly around the boat which lolls in a trough between waves.
 References to other 19th-century paintings, including The Barque of Dante by Eugène Delacroix, The Slave Ship by J. M. W. Turner, and The Voyage of Life by Thomas Cole have been noted as well.[8] These three paintings (in the case of the Delacroix, a preliminary study) were in one of the finest public art collections in America in the mid 19th century, that of John Taylor Johnston of New York, and it is likely that Homer was familiar with the paintings; one of his own works, Prisoners from the Front, was in the same collection.[18] For art historian Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., The Gulf Stream is more richly informed by these artistic predecessors than by Homer's direct experiences at sea, with the circling sharks derived from the tortured souls of The Barque of Dante, the dramatic sea and sky inspired by The Slave Ship, and the ""mode of pictorial utterance"" akin to The Voyage of Life.[17]
 Elements in the painting have been interpreted as possessing funereal references: in addition to the black cross in the boat's bow, the open hatch (representing a tomb), ropes (for lowering the body), broken mast and torn sail (shroud) have been cited for symbolic meanings.[19] By contrast, the boat in Homer's painting Breezing Up (A Fair Wind) of 1876 featured an anchor in its bow, symbolic of hope.[19]
The sailor in The Gulf Stream ignores these allusions, as he pays no heed to the sharks, waterspout, nor the ship in the distance, and inverts the optimism of the romantic masterpiece Raft of the Medusa painted earlier in the century by Théodore Géricault.[19]
 Homer biographer Albert Ten Eyck Gardner believed The Gulf Stream was the artist's greatest painting, and art critic Sadakichi Hartmann called it ""one of the greatest pictures ever painted in America"".[13] Later assessments have been more critical of the ""almost excessive pathos of the dr"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fortune_Teller_(La_Tour),The Fortune Teller (La Tour),"The Fortune Teller is an oil painting of circa 1630 by the French artist Georges de La Tour. The work was uncovered in about 1960 and purchased that year by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. François Georges Pariset described the painting in The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, attributing it to La Tour—a likely choice given the calligraphic signature at top right: ""G. de La Tour Fecit Luneuilla Lothar"" (""G[eorges] de La Tour made this, Lunéville, Lorraine""). Its authenticity has been questioned in the intervening years, notably by the English art historian Christopher Wright, but The Fortune Teller is generally accepted as La Tour's work. The artist is better known for his chiaroscuro religious compositions, in which the figures are illuminated by a single light source and lack the elaborate costume detail of The Fortune Teller's characters.
 The painting catches a moment in which a young man of some wealth is having his fortune told by the old woman at right; she takes the coin from his hand, not only in payment, but as part of the ritual in which she will cross his hand with it. Most or all of the women portrayed are gypsies, and, furthering the stereotype of the time, they are depicted as thieves. As the young man is engrossed in the fortune-telling—an act which, if discovered, would have repercussions for both him and the gypsies—the leftmost woman is stealing the coin purse from his pocket, while her companion in profile has a hand ready to receive the loot. The pale-faced girl on the boy's left is less clearly a gypsy, but is also in on the act as she cuts a medal worn by the boy from its chain. The figures in the painting are close together, as if in a play, and the composition may have been influenced by a theatrical scene.
 The modern discovery of the painting is said to be traced to a French prisoner of war who viewed La Tour's works in a monograph and found a likeness with a painting hung in a relative's castle. A knowledgeable priest identified it as a La Tour work and informed the Louvre, which entered negotiations to buy the painting. The art dealer Georges Wildenstein outbid the museum, however, purchasing the painting in 1949 for 7.5 million francs. For a decade it remained with the dealer, until in 1960 the Metropolitan Museum of Art paid an undisclosed but ""very high sum of money""[1] for The Fortune Teller. How the painting had been able to leave France became a matter of controversy in the French press, and the writer André Malraux, then French Minister of Culture, attempted to explain to the National Assembly why the work did not end up in the Louvre. It later emerged that the export licence was signed by the art historian Germain Bazin, who was head of old master paintings at the Louvre; Wright speculates that he had sufficient doubt about the work not to want it for the Louvre.[2]
 La Tour was hardly known until the beginning of the 20th century, but became extremely highly regarded from the 1920s onwards. A large number of the paintings now attributed to La Tour have surfaced from obscurity, like the Metropolitan work, since he became well-known, and have become valuable. Many were in collections with a provenance going back to the 19th century or beyond, but others first appeared in the hands of dealers, and some have always been the subject of suspicion. 
 The English art historian Christopher Wright published The Art of the Forger in 1984, a book whose central claim is that the Metropolitan Fortune Teller, along with other works attributed to La Tour, is actually a forgery of the 1920s by the artist and restorer Emile Delobre (1873–1956). Wright says that the central girl's dress parodies De la Tour's mother in ""The Newborn"" (Rennes), suggesting a satire more typical of 20th-century than 17th-century humour. The painting is related to a work called The Cheat, which exists in two different versions: one in the Louvre[3] and one in the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas. The Cheat shows a group playing cards, where a young dandy is being cheated, and shares the interest in costume of The Fortune Teller. After lengthy analysis of X-ray photographs, details of the costume, and stylistic comparisons with other works, Wright concludes that of the three, only the Fort Worth Cheat is genuine.[4]
 Among his evidence is a claim that the word ""MERDE"" (French for ""shit"") could be seen in the lace collar of the young woman second from left. Anthony Blunt and others denied this, but in a letter of 1981 to The Burlington Magazine rebutting Wright's claims, two members of the Metropolitan curatorial staff accepted that the word was there, regarding it as the work of a recent restorer, and it was then removed in 1982.[5][6] Among those who joined Wright in his concerns were Diana de Marly, [7] Benedict Nicolson, editor of the Burlington Magazine, and Brian Sewell.[8]
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Met began a skylight replacement project that resulted in gallery closures; in response the museum loaned major works from the European collection, including 'The Fortune Teller', to the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art in an exhibition titled ‘European Masterpieces’.[9] [10]

 The work depicts a female toddler from Maryland and was painted in Baltimore.[1][2]
 It was rediscovered in the late 1950s by New York folk and modernist art dealer, Edith Halpert.[3] Afterward, it was included in numerous international exhibitions and is considered an icon of American folk painting.[4]
 After being acquired by Edgar William Garbisch and his wife, Bernice Chrysler Garbisch they donated it to the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1970. However, the museum made a decision in 1978 to focus on ""collecting in the 20th century.'' In 1988, it was sold for $660,000 at Sotheby's to art dealer Alexander Acevedo, more than 14 times the previous record at auction for any of Johnson's work.[4] Sotheby's folk-art specialist Nancy Druckman described it as ""one of the most widely exhibited folk portraits.""[4]
 After the auction closed, actor Bill Cosby, owner of multiple Johnson works, was a critic of the sale.[4]
 The work was acquired by The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2016.[5]

 Prominent American painter John Singer Sargent took two notable trips to the Middle East during his lifetime; the first trip was to Greece, Egypt, and Turkey in 1890, while the second was to the-then Ottoman provinces of Syria and Palestine in 1905. These trips spurred Sargent to create a number of works of art concerning various subjects.[1]
 Arab Woman was produced by Sargent during his one of his travels in the Middle East. The image, done in watercolor and gouache on woven white paper, depicts a veiled Muslim woman wearing a white niqāb. According to an inscription left by Sargent on the painting, the work is incomplete.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_Revealed,Beauty Revealed,"
 Beauty Revealed is an 1828 self-portrait by the American artist Sarah Goodridge, a watercolor portrait miniature on a piece of ivory. Depicting only the artist's bared breasts surrounded by white cloth, the 6.7-by-8-centimeter (2.6 by 3.1 in) painting, originally backed with paper, is now in a modern frame. Goodridge, aged forty when she completed the miniature, depicts breasts that appear imbued with a ""balance, paleness, and buoyancy"" by the harmony of light, color, and balance. The surrounding cloth draws the viewer to focus on them, leading to the body being ""erased"".[1]
 Goodridge gave the portrait to statesman Daniel Webster, who was a frequent subject and possibly a lover, following the death of his wife; she may have intended to provoke him into marrying her. Although Webster married someone else, his family held onto the portrait until the 1980s, when it was auctioned at Christie's and acquired by Gloria and Richard Manney in 1981. The couple donated or sold the miniatures of their art collection, including Beauty Revealed, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006.
 Beauty Revealed is a self-portrait by Sarah Goodridge, depicting her bared breasts,[2] pink nipples,[1]  and a beauty mark.[3] These are presented in a gradation of color, giving a three-dimensional effect.[1] Although Goodridge was aged forty when she painted this miniature, according to art critic Chris Packard her breasts seem younger, with a ""balance, paleness, and buoyancy"" which is imbued in part by the harmony of light, color, and balance.[1] The breasts are framed by a swirl of pale cloth, which in parts reflects the light.[1][3]
 The 6.7-by-8-centimeter (2.6 by 3.1 in) painting is set in a case;[4] it had originally been installed on a paper backing which had the date ""1828"" on the reverse.[5] The work is a watercolor painting on ivory,[6] thin enough for light to shine through and thus allow the depicted breasts to ""glow"".[1] This medium was common for American miniatures,[7] but in this case also served as a simile for the flesh presented upon it.[3]
 Beauty Revealed was completed during a period of popularity of portrait miniatures, a medium which had been introduced in the United States in the late 18th century. By the time Goodridge completed her self-portrait, miniatures were increasing in complexity and vibrance.[7] The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History describes Beauty Revealed as a play on the eye miniatures which were then popular as tokens of affection in England and France, but not common in the United States.[6][8] Such miniatures allowed portraits of loved ones to be carried by their suitors without revealing the sitters' identities.[8]
 Goodridge was a prolific Boston-based portrait miniature painter who had studied under Gilbert Stuart and Elkanah Tisdale.[1] She had a long-term association with  Daniel Webster, a politician who began services as senator from Massachusetts in 1827. Webster sent her more than forty letters between 1827 and 1851, and in time, his greetings to her became increasingly familiar; his last letters were addressed to ""My dear, good friend"", which was uncharacteristic of his usual writing style.[5] She, meanwhile, painted him more than a dozen times and left her hometown of Boston to visit him in Washington, D.C. at least twice, once in 1828 after his first wife's death and again in 1841–42, when Webster was separated from his second wife.[6]
 Goodridge completed Beauty Revealed in 1828, likely from looking at herself in a mirror. Several works have been cited as possible inspirations, including John Vanderlyn's Ariadne Asleep on the Island of Naxos[9] and Horatio Greenough's sculpture Venus Victrix.[1] Goodridge sent her portrait to Webster when he was a new widower,[3][6] and, based on its miniature format, it was likely intended for his eyes alone.[1] The American art critic John Updike suggests that the artist intended it to offer herself to Webster; he writes that the bared breasts appear to say ""We are yours for the taking, in all our ivory loveliness, with our tenderly stippled nipples"".[10] Ultimately, however, Webster married another, wealthier woman.[3]
 After Webster's death, Beauty Revealed continued to be handed down by his family, together with another self-portrait Goodridge had sent to him. The politician's descendants held that Goodridge and Webster had been engaged. The painting was eventually auctioned through Christie's,[8] with a list price of $15,000,[11] and passed through Alexander Gallery of New York later that year before being purchased by New York-based collectors Gloria and Richard Manney.[5][12] The couple included Beauty Revealed in the exhibition ""Tokens of Affection: The Portrait Miniature in America"" in 1991, which toured to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met) in New York, the National Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C., and the Art Institute of Chicago.[12][13]
 Beauty Revealed was one of more than three hundred portrait miniatures compiled by the couple, who gave it to the Met in 2006, as part of a gift/purchase arrangement of their collection. Carrie Rebora Barratt and Lori Zabar of the Met describe Goodridge's self-portrait as the most compelling of the ""strange and wonderful"" miniatures by minor artists in the collection.[14] Two years later, Beauty Revealed was included in a retrospective, ""The Philippe de Montebello Years: Curators Celebrate Three Decades of Acquisitions"", which showcased works acquired under the tenure of retiring Met director Philippe de Montebello. Holland Cotter of The New York Times highlighted Goodridge's self-portrait, describing it as ""remarkable"".[2] In 2009, authors Jane Kamensky and Jill Lepore drew inspiration from Beauty Revealed (as well as other paintings, such as John Singleton Copley's Boy with a Squirrel) for their novel Blindspot.[15] As of 2014[update], the Met's website lists Beauty Revealed as not on display.[16]
 Art historian Dale Johnson described Beauty Revealed as ""strikingly realistic"", demonstrative of Goodridge's ability to portray nuanced lights and shadows. She found the stippling and hatching used in creating the painting to be delicate.[8] Writing in Antiques in 2012, Randall L. Holton and Charles A. Gilday said that the painting continued to present a self that evokes a ""frisson of erotic possibility"".[9]
 Packard wrote that Beauty Revealed served as a sort of visual synecdoche, representing the entirety of Goodridge through her breasts. As opposed to the ""burdened"" 1845 self-portrait and the non-eroticized one of 1830, he found Beauty Revealed to forefront Goodridge and her demand for attention. Arguing that the clothing surrounding her breasts served to indicate a performance (similar to the curtains of vaudeville), Packard described the viewer's eyes being focused on the breasts, while the rest of Goodridge's body was erased and abstracted.[1] This, he stated, challenged the assumptions and stereotypes regarding the demure, homebound 19th-century woman.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Saint_Peter_(Caravaggio),The Denial of Saint Peter (Caravaggio),"The Denial of Saint Peter (La Negazione di Pietro) is a painting finished around 1610 by the Italian painter Caravaggio. It depicts Peter denying Jesus after Jesus was arrested. The painting is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.[1]
 The Denial of Saint Peter is generally thought to be one of the last two works by Caravaggio, the other being The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula. It was probably finished at Naples in the summer of 1610.[2] This dating is made on stylistic and compositional grounds, especially by comparison to the Saint Ursula.[3]
 In 1612, the painter Guido Reni left Rome for his native Bologna and on 9 March 1612 gave instructions to the engraver Luca Ciamberlano to collect the remainder of his fees from Reverenda Camera Apostolica  for the frescos he had painted in the Borghese Chapel in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Ciamberlano again acted on his behalf on 12 September 1612 in the collection of some other debts. The combined sum owed to Reni amounted to 350 scudi. It seems that Ciamberlano was late in the forwarding of this money, for on 3 May 1613 Reni appointed Alessandro Albini to collect. Summoned before the notary Simon Petrus Corallus, Ciamberlano offered ""a painting by the hand of the late master Michelangelo da Caravaggio, which they say portrays the denial of St Peter with a maid."" It was valued highly at 240 scudi and accepted by Albini in payment. The balance, 110 scudi, was paid over the next seven years.[4]
 A number of artists active in Rome about this time must have known of the painting. Its influence is to be seen in a work by José de Ribera, now in the Galleria Corsini, Rome, dated to ca. 1613–15. Lionello Spada also completed at least two autograph works based on the painting,[3] one in a private collection, the other in the Galleria Nazionale, Parma. Spada returned to Bologna from Rome and Malta in 1614.[1]
 Reni must have disposed of the painting some time within the next decade since it appears in Cardinal Paolo Savelli's inventory taken at the Ariccia palace in 1624. Savelli was a patron of Orazio Gentileschi, a contemporary of Caravaggio in Rome, of whom he owned at least twelve paintings.[1]
 The cardinal died in 1632, leaving it to his brother, Federico Savelli (died 1649), who in his turn left it to his nephew Cardinal Fabrizio Savelli. In 1650 the Savelli collection was offered for sale to the Duke of Modena and the picture must have been sold soon thereafter.[1]
 In 1798, Matthew Pilkington noted a painting in the Certosa di San Martino in Naples ""by Caravaggio, representing the Denial of St. Peter, with figures at half-length and as large as life"".[5] A document of 28 September 1655[6] states it was sold to the Certosa by architect Cosimo Fanzago and was hung above the door to the sacristy. Bernardo de' Dominici described this painting in the third volume of his Vite dei Pittori, Scultori, ed Architetti Napolitani (1742) as ""a miracle of art, executed with such power of truth that it triumphs over whatever work is near it"".[7] Battistello Caracciolo had made a copy of this painting, now lost. It is not known whether this painting is the same as the present; some time after Bernardo de' Dominici remarked on it, it was removed and presumably sold.[8] Giovanni Pietro Bellori  (1672) wrote ""it depicts the serving maid pointing to Peter, who turns with open hands in the act of denying Christ; and it is painted in nocturnal light with other figures warming themselves at a fire "".[8] Thus there appears to be a second version of Caravaggio's Denial of St Peter unaccounted for.
 Shortly after the Second World War the present painting was purchased by Vincenzo Imparato Caracciolo of Naples on the Neapolitan art market as an anonymous work from an antiques dealer. After its restoration in 1959–64, it came to be attributed to Caravaggio, on the basis of style, by Roberto Longhi.[4]
 It was owned by his daughter principessa Elena Imparato Caracciolo, Naples until between 1964 and 1970, when it was sold to Ian Dik of Lausanne, Switzerland. Dik sold it to Herman Shickman of New York, from whose collection it was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1997.[1]
 According to the account in the Gospels (Matthew 26:69–75; Mark 14:66–72; Luke 22:55–62; John 18:17–18, 25–27), when Christ was arrested Peter followed him into the courtyard ""to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year"" (following John 18:13). There he was accused at three separate confrontations of being a disciple of Jesus. Peter denied each and thus fulfilled Christ's prophecy that before the cock crowed he would deny him thrice.[2]
 In October 1609, Caravaggio was attacked by assailants at the Osteria del Cerriglio tavern in Naples, led by Giovanni Rodomonte Roero, the Conte della Vezza. It seems he never fully recovered from the attack and this is evidenced by broad brushwork and an unfocused quality to the work.[2] The style of the picture is similar to the Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Banca di Napoli), with which it must be more or less contemporary.[1] Caravaggio crops the figures closely and smothers large areas in shadow in order to avoid any awkward depictions of human physicality.[2] His paintings also represented a psychological intensity which was common in his later work.[9] A similar helmet was used by Battistello Caracciolo in his Liberation of Saint Peter (1615) in the Pio Monte della Misericordia, Naples.[1]
 Appearing ominously in a 2014 episode of The Walking Dead, the painting is in Grady Hospital after being recovered outside of the High Museum in apocalyptic Atlanta. It is unclear whether the writers of The Walking Dead TV series were mistaken or on purpose used Caravaggio's ""The Denial of Saint Peter"". Since 1997, Caravaggio's painting has been a permanent part of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The High in Atlanta does have a painting named ""The Denial of Saint Peter"", but that painting is by the French artist Nicolas Tournier and was painted in 1630 and thus 20 years later than Caravaggio's painting. Nicolas Tournier was heavily influenced by Caravaggio's painting of the same name.[10]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_with_the_Virgin_and_St_John,Crucifixion with the Virgin and St John,"The Crucifixion with the Virgin and St John by Hendrick ter Brugghen is an oil painting, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was probably painted c. 1625 as an altarpiece for a Catholic schuilkerk, a ""hidden church"" or ""church in the attic"", in the Calvinist Dutch United Provinces, probably Utrecht. When discovered in a bombed out church in South Hackney, London in 1956, it was unknown, but by the time it appeared in Sotheby's salesroom in November of that year it was recognized as an important example of Utrecht Caravaggism. It was acquired by the museum in the sale.[2][3]
 Although the date is partly illegible, stylistically it comes closest to Ter Brugghen's Saint Sebastian Tended by Irene at the Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin, which is dated 1625. It was probably commissioned for a chapel or private church, although some contention has existed over whether this would have been Catholic or Protestant.[3]
 The posthumous inventory of Johannes de Renialme, for a sale of June 27, 1657, lists as no. 137 Een Christus aen 't cruys, van Van der Brugge, there valued at 150 guilders; possibly this painting.[4] It served as an altarpiece in a side chapel of Christ Church, South Hackney, London, between about 1898 and 1956, when the church was demolished and the painting moved to the Church of St John-at-Hackney. The church sold the painting to Nigel Foxell of Oxford for £75.[2] Foxell consigned the painting to auction at Sotheby's on 28 November 1956. It realised £15,000 (lot 115).[5] Foxell donated the proceeds (minus Sotheby's 10% commission) to the Diocese of London.
 Ter Brugghen's scene is taken from the Gospel of John: ""When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.""  John  19:26-27[6] The dead Christ is mourned by Mary and John the Apostle. At the base of the cross are bones, traditionally identified as the bones of Adam. The scene is set in an atmosphere of deep dusk; stars visible in the background.[7]
 The low horizon and the height at which this work, as an altarpiece would have been displayed, brings the viewer in direct confrontation with the skull and bones, telling us where we are in geographically (Golgotha, the place of a skull) and existentially (in the form of a memento mori).[3] The head of Christ bears a resemblance to the Christ in Ter Brugghen's The Incredulity of Saint Thomas (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), painted between 1621 and 1623.[1] Another indication that Ter Brugghen might have used models more than once, is the similarity between his Saint Sebastian in the Oberlin picture and Saint John here.[3]
 The starry sky is given us by the Gospel of Matthew: ""Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour."" Matthew  27:45[8]
Ter Brugghen renders it so naturalistically that we have reason to believe he had actually witnessed a total solar eclipse, and we know there had been one when he was still in Rome, on Wednesday, October 12, 1605,[9] although the site of total eclipse in Italy was Sicily.[10] It seems as likely to be a similar stylistic device to that used in his Saint Sebastian.[1]
 Perhaps the strongest indication that the picture is situated in the context of the Counter-Reformation in Utrecht, and thus would have been painted for a Catholic client, is the unnatural, archaic rendering of the blood from Christ's wounds. Christ's blood looks like it has been painted on the picture plane, and could thus serve as a strong symbol of the Eucharist. In this context Mary acts as intercessor for the faithful.[1] This motif of blood was frequently employed in painting before 1400, and shortly after, such as in a Jan van Eyck Crucifixion (1430) in Berlin, but was rarely used in Ter Brugghen's time due to the iconoclasm of the Calvinists and the post-Tridentine Catholic theologians.[7]
 If Mary represents the Church, John represents the priesthood. They are set apart from Christ, who is depicted archaically, by their stylistically modern, Caravaggesque  appearance. While the viewer would have been comfortable with the familiar iconographic depiction of Christ, the sophisticate would have appreciated the fashionable depiction of John and Mary and relished the references to other familiar works.[7] The composition has been compared to that of a widely distributed (by Ter Brugghen's time) 1511 engraving by Albrecht Dürer, along with the Calvary of Hendrik van Rijn (1363), which the painter would have seen in St. John's Church, Utrecht, and the Crucifixions of the German Mathis Grünewald (c. 1470 – 1528).[3][7]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bathing_Pool,The Bathing Pool,"The Bathing Pool (French: Le Bassin de baignade) is an oil-on-canvas painting executed between 1777 and 1780 by the French painter Hubert Robert. Originally commissioned for the bathing room at the Château de Bagatelle, it is now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
 The Bathing Pool is one of six paintings that Charles Philippe, comte d'Artois (1757–1836) commissioned from Robert in 1777. The paintings were for the bathing room at the Château de Bagatelle.[1] The six paintings depict generally Italian locations. The Bathing Pool, dated to 1777–1780, was made as a pendant to A Corner of the Courtyard of the Capitol.[2]
 The scene depicts an open woodland temple with an ancient Venus statue at its centre. The ruined building is flanked by trees and has a set of stairs leading to a pool, where water flows from four fountains. The fountains furthest to the sides are decorated with statues: to the left one of a sitting Venus, and to the right one of Mercury fastening his sandals. A blurry group of six women in 18th-century clothes stand at the top of the stairs. To the bottom left, next to the Venus statue, a sitting woman dries her feet in front of a maid. In the pool two nude women play in the shallow water.[1]
 The appearance of the temple is likely inspired by the Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, the Macellum of Pozzuoli (then thought to be a temple of Jupiter Serapis), and possibly Donato Bramante's Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio.[2] The central statue is based on an ancient model, and those on the sides are based on sculptures by Jean-Baptiste Pigalle (1714–1785).[1] The woman drying herself follows a painting by François Boucher (1703–1770).[3] The nudes were inspired by Claude Joseph Vernet (1714– 789), who had populated timeless Italian marine views with nude women.[4]
 The painting depicts an imaginary location with contemporary visitors. It has decidedly modern elements, such as 18th-century French cloaks and hoods, a woman pointing at a statue like a tourist, and a pair of modern pink shoes belonging to a bather. The contemporary allusions make the nudity atypical; 18th-century paintings normally restricted nudity to mythological and allegorical subjects.[5]
 In his 2006 book Logics of Worlds, the post-Marxist philosopher Alain Badiou analysed the painting as an example of how ""pictoral assemblage"" fundamentally is about ""distributing identities and differences"".[6] He saw the composition of temple, women, statues and water as ""a subtle transcendental network of identities"", exalted by ""figurative differences"", which place the painting in the genre of neoclassicism.[7] Badiou concluded that ""the world"" of the painting is the juncture between eighteenth-century eroticism and pre-romanticism.[8] Finally, he used the correspondences between the statues and groups of women, and the foliage to the left and the clearing to the bottom left, to argue that existence merely is a category of appearing.[9]
 The six paintings remained at the Château de Bagatelle until 1808, when Napoleon's Administration des Domaines sold them at auction to Jacques-Nicolas Brunot. Brunot sold them to Pierre Justin Armand Verdier, comte de Flaux. They were at the Château de Flaux until 1910–1911, when J. P. Morgan bought them through Maurice de Verneuil. They were on loan from Morgan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from May 1912 and gifted to the museum by Morgan's estate in 1917.[1] They were part of the exhibition Œuvres d'Hubert Robert at Galerie Thos in Paris from 12 to 30 March 1912, lent by Morgan.[4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_(Corpus_Hypercubus),Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus),"Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus) is a 1954 oil-on-canvas painting by Salvador Dalí. A nontraditional, surrealist portrayal of the Crucifixion, it depicts Christ on a polyhedron net of a tesseract (hypercube). It is one of his best-known paintings from the later period of his career.
 During the 1940s and 1950s Dalí's interest in traditional surrealism diminished and he became fascinated with nuclear science, feeling that ""thenceforth, the atom was [his] favorite food for thought"". The atomic bombing at the end of World War II left a lasting impression; his 1951 essay ""Mystical Manifesto"" introduced an art theory he called ""nuclear mysticism"" that combined his interests in Catholicism, mathematics, science, and Catalan culture in an effort to reestablish classical values and techniques, which he extensively utilized in Corpus Hypercubus.[1]
 That same year, to promote nuclear mysticism and explain the ""return to spiritual classicism movement"" in modern art,[2] he traveled throughout the United States giving lectures. Before painting Corpus Hypercubus, Dalí announced his intention to portray an exploding Christ using both classical painting techniques along with the motif of the cube, and he declared that ""this painting will be the great metaphysical work of [his] summer"". Juan de Herrera's Treatise on Cubic Forms was particularly influential to Dalí.[3]
 Corpus Hypercubus is painted in oil on canvas, and its dimensions are 194.3 cm × 123.8 cm (76.5 in × 48.75 in).[4] Consistent with his theory of nuclear mysticism, Dalí uses classical elements along with ideas inspired by mathematics and science. Some noticeably classic features are the drapery of the clothing and the Caravaggesque lighting that theatrically envelops Christ, though like his 1951 painting Christ of Saint John of the Cross, Corpus Hypercubus takes the traditional biblical scene of Christ's Crucifixion and almost completely reinvents it. The union of Christ and the tesseract reflects Dalí's opinion that the seemingly separate and incompatible concepts of science and religion can in fact coexist.[5] Upon completing Corpus Hypercubus, Dalí described his work as ""metaphysical, transcendent cubism"".[3]
 While he did attempt to distance himself from the Surrealist movement after his development of nuclear mysticism, in Corpus Hypercubus Dalí incorporates dreamlike features consistent with his earlier work, such as the levitating Christ and the giant chessboard below. Jesus' face is turned away from the viewer, making it completely obscured. The crown of thorns is missing from Christ's head as are the nails from his hands and feet, leaving his body completely devoid of the wounds often closely associated with the Crucifixion. With Christ of Saint John of the Cross, Dalí did the same in order to leave only the ""metaphysical beauty of Christ-God"".  Dalí sets the painting at the bay of his hometown Port Lligat in Catalonia, which is also the setting of other paintings of his including The Madonna of Port Lligat, The Sacrament of the Last Supper, and Christ of Saint John of the Cross.
 A viewer's eyes may quickly be drawn to the knees of Christ, which have a grotesque exaggeration of hyperrealistic detail. On close observation of the original painting, five different images of Dalí's wife Gala appear in Christ's right knee, and five different images of Dalí himself appear in the left knee; the most prominent two being Gala's back/neck/back of head with right arm extended upward, and Dalí's own face complete with his trademark upswept mustache. The additional embedded images are more difficult to see in low-quality reproductions or prints.
 The most striking change Dalí makes from nearly every other crucifixion painting concerns the cross, which he transforms into an unfolded net of a tesseract (also known as a hypercube). The unfolding of a tesseract into eight cubes is analogous to unfolding the sides of a cube into six squares. The use of a hypercube for the cross has been interpreted as a geometric symbol for the transcendental nature of God. Just as the concept of God exists in a space that is incomprehensible to humans, the hypercube exists in four spatial dimensions, which is equally inaccessible to the mind. The net of the hypercube is a three-dimensional representation of it, similar to how Christ is a human form of God that is more relatable to people.
 The word ""corpus"" in the title can refer both to the body of Christ and to geometric figures, reinforcing the link Dalí makes between religion and mathematics and science.[6] Christ's levitation above the Earth could symbolize His rise above Earthly desire and suffering. The motif of the cube is present elsewhere: Gala is standing on one, and the chessboard is made up of squares.
 On the bottom left of the painting, Dalí painted his wife Gala as Mary Magdalene looking up at Jesus. Dalí thought of her as the ""perfect union of the development of the hypercubic octahedron on the human level of the cube"". He used her as a model because ""the most noble beings were painted by Velázquez and Zurbarán. [He] only [approaches] nobility when painting Gala, and nobility can only be inspired by the human being.""[3]
 Fiona Macdonald describes the painting as showing a classical pose of Christ superimposed on a mathematical representation of the fourth dimension that is both unseeable and spiritual, considering it to be ""arguably the greatest expression of [Dalí's] scientific curiosity"".[7] Gary Bolyer assesses it as ""one of the most beautiful works of the modern era.""[8]
 Novelist Ayn Rand declared Corpus Hypercubus to be her favorite painting, and she would spend hours contemplating it at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She felt a connection between John Galt's defiance over his spiritual ordeal in her novel Atlas Shrugged and Dalí's portrayal of Christ in the painting.[9]
 A reproduction of the painting is mentioned in J. G. Ballard's 1969 surrealist novel, The Atrocity Exhibition and in Robert J. Sawyer's 1998 science fiction novel, Factoring Humanity.
 After being first exhibited in Rome in 1954, Corpus Hypercubus was acquired in 1955 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, where it was renamed Crucifixion. After nearly 25 years, the painting was loaned to the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Daimaru Museum in Osaka, and the Tate Gallery in London from December 1979 until June 1980. Throughout the early and mid 1980s Crucifixion was loaned to museums in Japan, Mexico, and Spain, including the Palau Reial de Pedralbes in Barcelona, the only time the painting has been exhibited in Catalonia, Dalí's home region.
 It was later loaned to the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart in Germany and the Pabellón de España at the Universal Exposition of Seville 1992 before being loaned long-term to the Salvador Dalí Museum (St. Petersburg, Florida) from 1993 to 1999. In 2000, it was loaned to the Wadsworth Atheneum in Connecticut from January to March and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC, as part of the traveling show ""Dalí's Optical Illusions"". In 2005, Corpus Hypercubus spent four months at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in a major retrospective of Dalí's work, and in 2006 it was loaned to the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, before returning to New York City.[4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barbarians_(painting),The Barbarians (painting),"The Barbarians (French: Les Barbares) is a 1937 painting by German surrealist painter Max Ernst.[2][3]
 From The Hartford Courant:
 Ernst's Surrealist paintings are steeped in Freudian metaphor, private mythology, and childhood memories. One of his major themes centered on the image of the bird, which often incorporated human elements. Although some of these birds look benign, their mere presence appears to be ominous. He first coupled birds and windblown, apocalyptic animals in a series of small works entitled The Horde (1927), and he resumed the theme in 1935 in a series of even smaller paintings called The Barbarians, to which the present one belongs. In his biography of the artist, John Russell identified these creatures as expressions of Ernst's fearful anticipation of the impending devastation in Europe during World War II.[5]  In this small painting, a gigantic, malevolent-looking bird couple marches forward with seemingly mile-long strides. The dark female leads the way as her male companion turns to look at the strange animal-perhaps their offspring-clinging to his left arm. In the far distance, a tiny woman holds onto some undefined winged being. The strange patterns on the bodies of the main figures, which evoke fossils or geological formations, are the result of grattage (scraping). In this technique, the artist coated the canvas, or in this case, a piece of cardboard, with layers of paint and while it was still wet pressed it against objects that left imprints on the surface. Afterward, he used a brush to touch up the forms thus created, or scraped away layers of pigment.[5]

With the decorative elements, the complete painting measures 200.7 cm in height and 62.9 cm in width. This painting represents a combination of two established themes of Korean painting: birds and flowers. Also it consists of ten symbols of longevity—the sun, mountains eater, rocks, clouds, pine trees, turtles, cranes, deer and mushrooms. In the central scene, there is a cock and hens perched on a tree and a rock respectively. This represents fortune and future. Currently, the painting is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, United States.[1]
 In the traditional Chinese culture, the rooster had been given a significant place. Ancient Chinese people believed that the rooster was a kind of moral animal with excellent qualities. This aspect also affected the neighboring Asian countries.[2] In the Joseon dynasty of the Korean peninsula, auspicious creatures such as the tiger, dragon, crane and deer were represented in a series of artworks demonstrating the importance and universality of these creatures in the Korean Art and culture. The painting, ""Golden Cock and Hen"" was created in the early 19th century AD, during Korean peninsula’s Joseon dynasty. The painting itself measures 114.3 cm in height and 45.7 cm in width. With the external decorative elements, the complete piece measures 200.7 cm in height and 62.9 cm in width. Due to the lack of documentation, the artist and the specific creation date of the painting cannot be predicated.[1]
 In 1919, this painting was granted to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York by Rogers Foundation. Between 1984 and 2015 the painting has been displayed seven times in New York, New Orleans, Honolulu, San Francisco, Tulsa and Los Angeles.[1]

 Hodler painted Dream in 1896. Unlike his previous, more realist works, Dream shows Hodler's interest in symbolism.[1]
 Dream was first shown during the Swiss national exhibition in Geneva. Sources have commented that Hodler's submittance of Dream to the 1896 exebition was possibly done to provoke the Swiss art community, noting that Hodler's rendering of copious nude figures in the painting may have been influenced by rejections of his earlier works as being too sexual. In addition, Hodler debuted the painting at the Théâtre du Sapajou in Geneva, possibly an intentional choice given the theater was associated with satire. According to the Met's description of Dream, the painting and situation surrounding its debut earned Hodler ""considerable"" notoriety.[1]

 The Forest in Winter at Sunset was painted by Théodore Rousseau between 1846 and 1867. The large painting (described by one source as ""monumental""[1]) took years for the artist to complete; it was only at the urging of friends that Rousseau finished the scene. Rousseau is widely recognized for his melancholic landscape paintings, which made extensive use of a muted color palette.[2] This reputation is reflected in Forest; set in Fontainebleau forest during a winter sunset, Rousseau's scene features a dense thicket of foliage set beneath a sallow sky. Deep colors are employed to add depth to the painting, while the defined lines of the larger trees stand out from the more-amorphous mass of smaller plants. Given that the scene is set in December 1854, every branch and is bare, further adding to the character of the painting. Two stooped peasants can be seen in the center of the painting, where they are dwarfed by the empty trees above.[1][2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunziata_Polyptych,Annunziata Polyptych,"The Annunziata Polyptych is a  painting cycle started by Filippino Lippi and finished by Pietro Perugino, whose central panel is now divided between the Galleria dell'Accademia (Deposition from the Cross) and the Basilica dell'Annunziata, both in Florence, Italy. The polyptych had other six panels, which are housed in the Lindenau-Museum of Altenburg, the Metropolitan Museum of  New York City, the  Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome and in a private collection in South Africa.
 The work was originally commissioned to Filippino Lippi for the high altar of the Annunziata Basilica in Florence. Lippi had already ceded the same commission to Leonardo da Vinci, who had executed a cartoon with St. Anne, the Virgin and the Child, before abandoning the work when he followed Cesare Borgia (1502). The work was thus reassigned to Lippi, who changed completely the theme. At his death in 1504 the painting, already completed in the central part, was assigned to Pietro Perugino, who completed it, including the secondary panels, in 1507.
 Once finished, the painting was sharply criticized by the Florentines, due to the alleged lack of originality of the composition. At the time, Perugino was often re-using the same cartoons, due to big number of commissions. The Annunciation altarpiece was thus Perugino's last work in Florence.
 The work was originally painted on two sides: the Assumption of the Virgin facing  the faithful, and the Deposition from the Cross facing the choir. After the panel was split in two, the latter was moved in the Grand Duke's collections, and then to the Gallerie dell'Accademia; the Assumption remained in the church, and was later moved to the Rabatta Chapel. The polyptych had a frame designed by Baccio d'Agnolo.
 The Deposition shows the moment in which Jesus Christ is taken down from the cross after his death. Four men are carrying out the task by using ladders. On the ground, at the left, is the Virgin, fainting in the Swoon of the Virgin, and supported by the other Pious Women. The person praying at the foot of the cross is Mary Magdalene, regarding reverently the feet that she had so recently washed and anointed.  On the right, caught in a surprised posture, is St. John the Apostle; in front of him, on the ground, are the nails of the crucifixion. It could also be that he is advising the men to be careful with their task, to handle the body of the Lord with ultimate care.
 According to Giorgio Vasari, Lippi executed the upper part of the painting. Jesus, left unfinished, was completed by Perugino concerning the face. The latter also painted the lower part of the work, characterized by his typical serene faces and the distant landscape. Perugino's assistants painted a great number of details, especially in the side panels.
 The polyptych was completed by a predella, now divided between several American museums. It included:

Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a Bashi-bazouk, an irregular soldier of the Ottoman Empire. The painting is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Painted by Jean-Léon Gérôme between 1868 and 1869, the painting depicts a dark-skinned model dressed as a Bashi-bazouk, a levy of irregular Ottoman soldiers infamous for their brutality, looting, and lack of discipline.[2] Gérôme acquired the garb seen in the painting during a trip to the near east in 1868. The haphazard and mixed textiles the model is dressed in is reminiscent of the Bashi-bazouks, as the soldiers were traditionally unpaid and did not adopt a standardized uniform, resulting in the soldiers wearing whatever they could acquire on a march. This a key point of the painting, as the brutal reputation of a Bashi-bazouk is contrasted by the silk tunic, quality clothes, and noble bearing of the subject.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Allegory_of_Faith,The Allegory of Faith,"The Allegory of Faith, also known as Allegory of the Catholic Faith, is a Dutch Golden Age painting by Johannes Vermeer from about 1670–1672. It has been in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since 1931.[1]
 This and Art of Painting are his only works that fall under history painting in the contemporary hierarchy of genres, though they still have his typical composition of one or two figures in a domestic interior. Both share several features: the perspective is almost the same, and there is a multicolor tapestry at the left of each painting, pulled to the left to disclose the scene. The Art of Painting also uses symbolism from Cesare Ripa of Clio, muse of history. Vermeer's Love Letter uses a similar gilt panel.[2] The Allegory and The Art of Painting differ markedly in style and purpose from Vermeer's other works.
 The painting depicts a woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests on the edge of a table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen.[2] Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole.[1] Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer.[2] A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.
 Vermeer's iconography in the painting is largely taken from Cesare Ripa's Iconologia, an emblem book (a collection of allegorical illustrations with accompanying morals or poems on a moral theme) which had been translated into Dutch in 1644 by D. P. Pers. The artist used various symbols that Ripa described and illustrated in his book, along with symbols taken from other books and traditions. Two of the four allegorical figures of Faith (""Fede. Geloof"" and ""Fede Catholica. Catholijck of algemeen Geloof"") given in Ripa's book provide many of the symbols in the painting, including the color of the woman's clothing, her hand gesture, and the presence of the crushed snake and the apple.[2]
 In his book, Ripa states that Faith is the most important of the virtues. One image in the book shows her as a woman, dressed in white (signifying light and purity) and blue (which relates to heaven, as Ripa states in another text). Faith's hand on her breast symbolizes that the virtue rests in her heart. Christ is represented in the cornerstone crushing the snake (a symbol of the Devil), and the apple (the fruit Eve gave to Adam) represents original sin,[2] which in Christian doctrine required the sacrifice of the Saviour.[1] Ripa describes Faith as ""having the world under her feet"", and Vermeer used the symbol quite literally, showing a globe of the earth under the woman's right foot. (The globe, with its distinctive cartouche (decorative label) has been identified as one made by Hendrick Hondius).[2]
 The crucifix, painting of the Crucifixion and the glass orb are not mentioned by Ripa, and Vermeer changed some of the iconography that Ripa gave: Instead of Ripa's suggestion that Faith hold the chalice and rest her hand on a book, Vermeer put them on the table next to her. According to Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., a University of Maryland academic and curator of a Vermeer exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, this is ""an assemblage that gives the image a Eucharistic character not found in the text."" By putting the golden chalice against the dark background of the painting's frame and the dark crucifix against the gilt-leather backdrop, the elements are given a greater prominence in the painting. Wheelock, citing his fellow academic at the University of Maryland, Quint Gregory, believes the slight overlapping of the chalice and the gold backdrop of the crucifix ""may symbolically suggest the essential role of the Eucharist in bridging the physical and spiritual realms"", a very Catholic idea.[2] Selena Cant calls the fact that the book, chalice and crucifix together represent the Catholic Mass.[3]
 The pose of the woman (hand on heart and eyes raised) is similar to Ripa's image of Theology. The pose was uncommon in Dutch art, but Vermeer was considered an expert in Italian painting, in which the image was often used (especially those of Guido Reni [1575–1642], whose works were then owned in Holland).[2] Wheelock believes the large book, which has a metal clasp, is a Bible, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art states on its website that the volume may be the Catholic Missale Romanum.[1]
 The painting's iconography is not only Catholic, but some believe it is strongly influenced by Jesuit ideas. Departing from Ripa's allusion to the story of Abraham and Isaac (an Old Testament story said to prefigure the faithful sacrifice of Christ on the Cross), Vermeer instead uses an image of the Crucifixion itself — an image dear to the Jesuits. Vermeer used Crucifixion, a painting from about 1620 by Jacob Jordaens (1593–1678). The painter may have owned a copy of the painting.[2] (This may be ""the large painting representing Christ on the Cross"" described in an inventory of his household at his death. Two other items in the inventory may be in this painting: the ""gold-tooled leather on the wall"" of his home's kitchen, and an ""ebony wood crucifix"").[3]
 Another Jesuit influence in the painting is said to be the glass orb on which the woman sets her eyes. According to Eddy De Johgh, Vermeer appears to have taken it from a 1636 emblem book by the Jesuit Willem Hesius, Emblemata sacra de fide, spe, charitate. In the emblem, ""Capit Quod Non Capit"", a winged boy, a symbol of the soul, is shown holding a sphere reflecting a nearby cross and the sun. In a poem accompanying the emblem, Hesius states that the sphere's ability to reflect the world is similar to the mind's ability to believe in God.[4] Selena Cant has written that the sphere is ""symbol of the human mind and its capacity both to reflect and to contain infinity.""[3]
 The woman's pearl necklace probably relates to pearls as ancient symbols of virginity, according to Cant. There is no source for the light on her dress, perhaps indicating that she is lit by an inner illumination[3] — a strong indication to the viewer that she is not to be considered an individual, but a symbol, according to Walter Liedtke.[5]
 Many art historians have considered the painting one of Vermeer's less successful works. Cant, for instance, calls it ""harder, more brittle, less convincing. Faith herself appears uncomfortable: finely dressed, she appears too worldly to be a spiritual symbol, too solid to appear transported, the intimacy too forced and her expression too artificial.""[3]
 According to Wheelock, ""[T]he iconographic demands of this subject strained the credibility of his realistic approach. While essential for the painting's symbolic content, the ecstatic pose of the woman and the crushed snake seem incongruous within this Dutch setting.""[2] Walter Liedtke objected to Wheelock's point by asserting that the artist took a very realistic approach primarily in depicting the terrestrial globe and reflections in the glass sphere. Instead, according to Liedtke, the painting is best compared to contemporary Dutch paintings illustrating abstract concepts, including Adriaen Hanneman's Allegory of the Peace (1664; still in situ at the E"

The painting is an elaborate oil sketch made by Tiepolo in preparation for rendering a similar, larger version of his scene a massive fresco.[1][2] Between December 1750 and November 1753, Tiepolo was commissioned to decorate the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg Karl Philipp von Greifenclau zu Vollraths newly constructed palace on the ceiling of a staircase he created a massive fresco of over 600 m², it is considered the largest fresco in the world and is often considered his greatest achievement.  The oil on canvas is an earlier version of his work.[1][3] The intricate painting depicts figures circling around Tiepolo's rendering of Apollo, the sun god; this represents planets orbiting the Sun. The cornice of the painting symbolize the continents Europe, America, Africa, and Asia.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypresses_(Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art),Cypresses (Metropolitan Museum of Art),"Cypresses is a late 19th-century painting by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh painted around June 1889.[1] Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a pair of cypress trees in the French countryside. The work is currently on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[2]
 Cypresses was painted by Vincent van Gogh while the post impressionist was a patient at Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy. While being held at the asylum, van Gogh was allowed to continue his painting; among other subjects,  the artist was interested in painting cypresses (which van Gogh described as ""beautiful as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk""[3]) and pines. This interest resulted in several paintings, including Cypresses, which was painted soon after van Gogh's arrival. The work was later shown at the 1890 meeting of the Salon des Indépendants in Paris.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle_with_a_Bust_of_Homer,Aristotle with a Bust of Homer,"Aristotle with a Bust of Homer (Dutch: Aristoteles bij de buste van Homerus), also known as Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of Homer, is an oil-on-canvas painting by Rembrandt that depicts Aristotle wearing a gold chain and contemplating a sculpted bust of Homer. It was created as a commission for Don Antonio Ruffo's collection. It was bought and sold by several collectors until it was eventually purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The mysterious tone in the painting has led several scholars to different interpretations of Rembrandt's theme.
 Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of Homer was painted in 1653, as a commission from a Sicilian nobleman named Don Antonio Ruffo, who did not request any particular subject.[1] Despite not knowing what Rembrandt would create, he was already eager to hang it in his Hall of Fame.[2] Don Antonio planned to commission companion pieces for Rembrandt's painting from the Italian painter Guercino.[2] Guercino decided that a cosmographer was the perfect match, since Rembrandt represented the study of mankind while the cosmographer represents the study of the heavens.[2] However, Guercino's piece disappeared for no apparent reason. According to Charles Mee, perhaps Don Antonio did not think it was good enough.[2] Rembrandt later created Homer Dictating his Verses and a lost painting of Alexander the Great for Ruffo, both ten years after completing Aristotle with a Bust of Homer.[3]
 In 1815, it was sent to Sir Abraham Hume and he lent it to an exhibition at the British Institution in London.[3] When Hume died, his descendants sold it to Rodolphe Kann in Paris.[3] Kann had a huge collection of notable valuables, but after his death, Rembrandt's painting was sent to other American collectors.[3]
 Eventually, it was purchased in 1961 for $2.3 million by the Metropolitan Museum of Art[1] in New York City, United States. At the time this was the highest amount ever paid for any picture at public or private sale.[4] This inspired the American artist Otis Kaye to critique the sale (and by extension the power of money in art) with his own painting Heart of the Matter, which is held at the Art Institute of Chicago.[5]
During the renovation of the Rembrandt wing of the Metropolitan Museum, the painting was re-titled in November 2013 as Aristotle with a Bust of Homer.
 There has been confusion over the identity of the man in the painting because Don Antonio Ruffo did not specifically request a subject for his commission.[6] It has been thought to be Albertus Magnus, Tasso, Ariosto, Virgil and seventeenth-century Dutch poet Pieter Cornelisz Hooft.[6] The identity of the subject was also challenged by Simon Schama in his book Rembrandt's Eyes. Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the ancient Greek painter Apelles who is depicted in Rembrandt's painting.[7] In 1969, Julius Held argued that it was Aristotle in the painting by analyzing his facial features, his clothes and the objects he holds.[6] According to Held, Aristotle is known for his long hair and beard, fancy jewelry and extravagant dresses, which can be seen in other paintings that featured him between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Europe.[6] Held also connects Aristotle with the bust of Homer and Alexander's chain. Aristotle is known to be a commentator of Homer and Alexander the Great, which led Held to believe that it must be Aristotle in the painting.[6]
 According to Charles Mee, the main theme of Rembrandt's paintings is the idea of contemplation.[2] The people in his paintings stare as if they are lost in thought, which makes this his most commonly used theme.[2] To achieve this, he picked a white gown to make Aristotle look more dignified.[2] Also, he painted a black apron, since the color black represents melancholy.[2] All of these elements helped create a feeling of deep contemplation, which is what the viewers could find relatable.[2] The Scientific Revolution was well underway by the 1650s, making Rembrandt's theme of contemplation a relatable subject.[2]
 To Theodore Rousseau, there is meaning to how Rembrandt draws Aristotle's eyes.[3] The shadows that partially conceal Aristotle's eyes show that he is lost in his thoughts.[3] The eyes usually hint at a person's inner thoughts, but the use of shadows implies that there is a mystery to what Aristotle is feeling at that moment.[3]  Rousseau also mentions Rembrandt's use of various brushstrokes and limited use of colors.[3] These art choices are supposed to imply the different moods he felt while he was painting this piece.[3]
 Aristotle, world-weary, looks at the bust of blind, humble Homer, on which he rests one of his hands. This has variously been interpreted as the man of sound methodical science deferring to art, or as the wealthy and famous philosopher, wearing the jeweled belt given to him by Alexander the Great, envying the life of the poor blind bard.[8] It has also been suggested that this is Rembrandt's commentary on the power of portraiture.[8] 
The interpretation of methodical science deferring to art is discussed at length in Rembrandt's Aristotle and Other Rembrandt Studies.[8] The author notes that Aristotle's right hand (traditionally the favored hand), which rests on the bust of Homer, is both higher and painted in lighter shades than the left hand on the gold chain given to him by Alexander.[8] He also said that the two objects represents his contrasting values: the bust being his persisting values, while the chain is his ever-changing values.[1]
 Carroll suggested that Aristotle is focusing on the ideas relating to the objects instead of the objects themselves.[9] She uses Rembrandt's other paintings with the same themes of contemplation to support her claim. For example, his St. Paul in Prison shows St. Paul pondering what he will write in his book, not solely on the book itself.[9] For Rembrandt's bust, it represents his ""attribute for learning"", or his educated past.[9]
 Beranek mentions that the gold chain is a token of great honor, since receiving gold is an old practice that recognizes someone's greatest achievement.[6] Beranek believed that the appeal of the painting is how it engages the viewers. As the audience watches Aristotle as he is deep in thought, they can contemplate along with him.[6]
 There are stacked books in the background painted in a realistic manner, which gives them importance to the scene.[10] According to Suthor, they represent the lingering reminder of a great poet.[10] Aristotle's hand has a warm color when it touches the bust of Homer, which implies a special bond Aristotle feels with Homer.[10] While the bust of Homer seems more visible than Alexander's chain, Rembrandt makes the chain seem as if it were protruding from the frame, thus giving it as much prominence as the bust.[10]
 The painting forms the central theme of Joseph Heller's 1988 novel Picture This. It explores Rembrandt's insight on society as he contemplates the value of money.[11]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au_Lapin_Agile,Au Lapin Agile,"Au Lapin Agile (English: At the Lapin Agile) is a 1905 oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso. It depicts the interior of the Lapin Agile, a famous cabaret club in the Montmartre area of Paris. The composition was produced during Picasso's Rose Period and includes a self-portrait of the artist who frequented the club in his youth. The painting is listed as one of the most expensive paintings after achieving a price of $40.7 million at Sotheby's auction on 27 November 1989. It is housed in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
 This painting was produced in 1905, just a few years after the young Picasso and his friend Carles Casagemas settled in Paris in 1900. Not only did they find a new social circle in the artists of Montmartre, but they also became acquainted with a married seamstress named Germaine Pichot. Casagemas became obsessed with Pichot and relentlessly pursued her, but his affections were never returned. Picasso and his friends frequented a local cabaret club known as the Lapin Agile, where they drank and exchanged ideas with other artists. On 17 February 1901, during an evening drink with friends, Casagemas shot at Pichot with a revolver and then shot himself in the head. Picasso was greatly affected by the death of his friend and this tragic event is considered to be the major catalyst for the onset of Picasso's Blue Period. However, despite this emotional trauma, Picasso had an affair with Pichot after the event. In 1905, he was asked by the owner of the Lapin Agile, Frédéric Gérard, to produce a painting that would be hung inside. Picasso agreed in exchange for free food and drinks and created Au Lapin Agile at the age of 25.[1]
 Au Lapin Agile depicts a melancholy image of a couple sitting at a bar inside the Lapin Agile. The composition is simple, with little background detail, except for the presence of the bar upon which the couple stand their drinks and the small stage at the rear. The painting features three figures, a harlequin in the foreground, a woman sitting next to him wearing an orange dress and a feather boa, and a guitarist playing in the background. Picasso conveys a sombre scene by primarily using murky reddish-brown hues. The style of this painting is reminiscent of the works of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.
 The painting depicts figures from Picasso's personal life during this period. The harlequin in the scene is a brooding self-portrait of Picasso, while the woman sitting next to him is Germaine Pichot. The guitarist is Frédéric Gérard, the new owner of the club. Picasso painted himself as the most prominent figure in the scene, ensuring that he would also hold a prominent position in the main room at the club where the painting was to be hung.[1]
 Columbia University art historian Theodore Reff has noted the alienation of the couple in the painting, which may reflect Picasso's own mood whilst in the company of Pichot, following the death of Casagemas.[1]
 Frédéric Gérard commissioned the painting and exhibited it at the Lapin Agile from 1905 to 1912, when it was sold to a German collector.[2]
 In 1952, Joan Whitney Payson bought the painting in New York for $60,000. When she died in 1975, it was inherited by her daughter, Lorinda de Roulet.[3]
 On 27 November 1989, Walter H. Annenberg bought the painting at auction from the Joan Whitney Payson family for $40.7 million. He gave the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[2][3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachrymae_(Frederic_Leighton),Lachrymae (Frederic Leighton),"
 Lachrymae is a late 19th-century painting by British artist Lord Frederic Leighton. Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts a conceptual figure inspired by classical antiquity. Lachrymae is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Lachrymae was painted by British artist Frederic Leighton between 1894 and 1895.[1] An influential artist, Leighton was notable for his love of history, and was known by the moniker 'Jupiter Olympus' due to his interest in classical antiquity.[1] A member of the British upper class, Leighton was given a traditional, classics-heavy education, and was educated in several cities notable for being bastions of classical art.[2] Following his rise as an artist in his own right, Leighton often associated himself with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, which often produced art depicting figures from Medieval and Classical lore. Leighton was considered to be a neoclassicist.[1][2]
 The painting itself depicts a woman leaning against a Doric column. The omnipresent theme of the work is mourning and death. The figure is dressed in black, and she leans against a pillar; some sources have postulated the pillar is a funerary monument.[2] Cypress trees—a traditional symbol of mourning—are visible in the background, and a withered wreath made of cypress leaves can be seen at the base of the column. As noted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art's profile of Lachrymae, the painting's tabernacle frame evokes thoughts of a temple doorway.[1] The painting's title, Lachrymae, translates to ""tears"" in Latin.[2]
 The painting has been compared to Electra at the Tomb of Agamemnon, one of Leighton's earlier works.[1] A study and several preliminary drawings (both done in chalk) of the subject's head are in the collection of the Leighton House Museum in London.[1] One source notes that the cypress rendered in Lachrymae is reminiscent of a drawing Leighton made in Florence in 1854.[1] The model Leighton used for the painting has been identified as Mary Loyd[2] (""Miss Loyd""[1]), who also served as the model for Flaming June, another of Leighton's famous works.[1]
 In addition to symbols of death, Lachrymae depicts pieces of Greek pottery Leighton likely used as props or inspiration.[1][2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Rhythm_(Number_30),Autumn Rhythm (Number 30),"Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) is a 1950 abstract expressionist painting by American artist Jackson Pollock in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.[1]  The work is a distinguished example of Pollock's 1947-52 poured-painting style, and is often considered one of his most notable works.[1][2]
 Autumn Rhythm was made in the fall of 1950 at Pollock's studio in Springs, New York, as part of a group of paintings he first exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery in November–December, 1951.[3]  Pollock's technique in the painting, like others made during this part of his career, involved working on unprimed canvas laid on the floor of his studio, pouring paint from cans or using sticks, heavily loaded brushes and other implements to control a stream of paint as he dripped and flung it onto the canvas.[4]  At 17 feet wide and 8 feet high, Autumn Rhythm is among Pollock's largest pictures.
 The creation of Autumn Rhythm was partly documented by Hans Namuth, who photographed Pollock at work over several months in 1950.[5]  According to art historian Monica Bohm-Duchen, Namuth's photographs lend insight to the sequence in which Pollock filled in the canvas, and the order in which paint colors were applied to the work.  Pollock began by painting the right third of the canvas, laying down a skein of thin black lines, and then adding other colors of paint (mostly browns and white, with a small amount of teal blue) using several methods of dripping and pouring to create a variety of types of lines and puddled areas of paint until the section began to resemble its finished state.  He then moved on to the center section, and ultimately the left-hand section using the same process.  Throughout the making of the work, he painted from all sides of the canvas.[6]
 Pollock gave the painting the title Number 30, and it was exhibited under that name at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1951, and at the Museum of Modern Art as part of its 15 Americans exhibition in 1952.[1][7]  From 1947 to 1952, Pollock gave his works numbers rather than titles in order not to distract viewers with implied meanings.[4]  The numbered titles do not appear to correspond to the sequence in which works were made.[8]  When the picture was shown at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1955, it carried the title Autumn Rhythm with no reference to the number.[1]  Pollock did not record why he changed the title of the painting; art historian Timothy J. Clark believes that Autumn Rhythm was Pollock's own title, in contrast to some other works of this period, which received title suggestions from Pollock's friend, critic Clement Greenberg.[9]  In 1957, the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the painting from Pollock's estate for $20,000 plus a trade of a work already in the Met collection, Number 17, 1951.  Met curator Robert Beverly Hale proposed and supervised the acquisition.[10]  Since then, the work has generally been exhibited as Autumn Rhythm (Number 30).[1]
 Researchers looking at the underlying fractal geometry of Pollock's work have estimated the fractal dimension of the drip patterns in Autumn Rhythm at 1.67.[11]
 The following have extended discussion of Autumn Rhythm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_Dish_and_Glass,Fruit Dish and Glass,"Fruit Dish and Glass (1912), by Georges Braque, is the first papier collé (pasted paper, colloquially known as collage).[1][2] Braque and Pablo Picasso made many other works in this medium, which is generally credited as a key turning point in Cubism.
 Braque was inspired to create this piece after visiting an Avignon shop where he purchased a roll of faux bois paper, simulating oak paneling and consisting of two kinds of printed motifs on a dark beige background, while traveling with Picasso and his companion, Eva Gouel, in Sorgues.[1] Braque said that he eyed the paper but waited to act on his ideas until Picasso went to Paris. Picasso was going to Paris for a week to organize his move to a new apartment on 242 Boulevard Raspail.[1]  After Picasso had left, Braque bought the paper and made several works starting with Fruit Dish and Glass. When Picasso returned, Braque showed him his work; later, Picasso copied the technique.
 Braque may have been drawn to this paper because he was trained in a technique called trompe-l'œil; which allowed him to create pictorial effects that resemble woodgrain and marble finishes, but are made with paint and a special wide comb.  Braque then may have found it amusing to incorporate the woodgrain paper in his piece.  He may also have wished to use the paper to create a visual pun about the nature of representation. He noticed that because the paper looks realistic and yet it is flat, and pasted on, it undermines spatial relationships. It can act as the foreground, the background, or both.
 In Fruit Dish and Glass the glass filled with grapes and pears are flattened and distorted versions of actual objects.  Braque used textures, shapes, and composition to construct a painting that is half recognizable and half symbolic.
 The piece is based on the interaction of wallpaper glued to the support and charcoal lines, which evoke both objects and words.  The subject matter is a glass bowl, pears, and grapes, between what looks like a dish and a wine glass, or perhaps a candlestick.  Braque probably began the work by cutting out pieces of wallpaper and moving them around a flat surface to imagine his composition.  He then might have positioned two strips of the wood grain wallpaper vertically on a large sheet of white paper to signify the walls of a café.  He also put a small horizontal piece of wallpaper at the bottom of the paper to represent a table top.  Then, he drew the glass, pears, grapes and the words ‘ALE’ and ‘BAR’ in charcoal and added black lines in ink to the wallpaper, and a circular knob to the horizon piece of wallpaper at the bottom to make it look like the drawer of a table. The work has a variety of textures that add confusion to spatial relations of the objects in the composition.  For example, in addition to the oak wallpaper, Braque used a comb to add an additional element of trompe-l'œil to give the piece even more perceptual distortion.  Braque also adds texture, applying a mix of sand and gessoto the background.  This texture brings the background forward, making it more difficult to interpret the perspective.  Braque’s process was deliberately mystifying. His technique is full of subtleties that one doesn't notice at first.  Both the physical and logical relationships of the objects are often difficult to construct.  The painting is a visual puzzle which challenges the viewer to understand what is shown from clues and fragments.
 The use of collage is usually credited with changing the face of cubism from analytic to synthetic, in which multiple systems of representation were used in a single canvas.[3]
 Clement Greenberg, in his 1959 essay ""Collage,"" argues that the illusionistic rendering of the grapes creates a trompe-l'œil effect that is immediately undermined by the flatness of the wood-grained wallpaper, but the charcoal lines that overlap the wallpaper seem to made it recede into space. This interplay and ambiguity between the literal flatness and perceived depth is a key hallmark of Cubism, and, to Greenberg, the entire development of modernist painting, whose key condition is flatness.[4]
 The work was purchased by one of Braque’s first collectors, Wilhelm Uhde. The piece remained with Uhde until 1921, when it was sold to a private collection.[1] In the 1950s, it was in the collection of Douglas Cooper.[4] It is now located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo,_the_Beautiful_Irishwoman","Jo, the Beautiful Irishwoman","Jo, the Beautiful Irishwoman (French: Jo, la belle irlandaise) is the title of a series of four oil on canvas bust-length portraits by Gustave Courbet. They all show the same redheaded Irish model Joanna Hiffernan (c.1843 – c.1905) looking in a mirror – she also modelled for Whistler. The works have minor differences in details and dimensions but their exact chronology is unknown. They are now in the Nationalmuseum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and a private collection.
 The nickname in the title indicates the friendship between the artist and his model and is unusual for contemporary portraits of women in that it gives the model's first name. They were probably painted in Trouville, where the painter spent August to November 1865 painting seascapes with Whistler and Joanna. On 17 November, towards the end of his stay, he wrote to his parents that he ""bore himself admirably"" and told them that he was Whistler's ""pupil"".[1] Whistler himself painted the portrait Courbet by the River or My Dear Courbet during the latter's stay with him.[2]
 Courbet had already painted a series of paintings of women looking in mirrors in 1860 - this had been quite successful with the public and was exhibited in Brussels. The best known from that series, Woman with a Mirror, was painted in Ornans in winter 1859–1860 and is now in the Kunstmuseum  Basel – it shows a brunette with a mirror (almost identical to that in Jo) and a prominent décolletage.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Presented_to_the_People_(Il_Sodoma),Christ Presented to the People (Il Sodoma),"Christ Presented to the People is a mid 16th century painting by Giovanni Antonio Bazzi, an Italian artist commonly known as Il Sodoma. Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts the biblical scene in which Jesus Christ is presented to the people by Pontius Pilate with the phrase ""Ecce homo"" (behold the man). The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Originally from Vercelli, Giovanni Antoni Bazzi, commonly known as Il Sodoma, was educated in Lombardy in the art of painting. Like many other high renaissance painters,  much of his work concerned Christian figures, scenes, and motifs. As a professional artist, Sodoma worked on commission for a number of clients throughout the early 16th century; some of these works were lost or incorrectly attributed to other artists.[1]
 As noted in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's profile of Sodoma's Christ Presented to the People, the work was not identified as being Sodoma's until the mid 19th century.[1] The Met and other scholars have attributed the work to between 1540 and 1549, making the painting one of Sodoma's late works.[1] The work is comparable in some areas (subject material, composition) to an early work (dated to 1525) by Sodoma depicting Christ being tormented by Pontius Pilate's soldiers, though the works do differ in some respects.[1]
 Christ Presented to the People's frame is itself historical, having been made in Sienna in 1540. The frame contains some gilding that may have been added in the 19th century.[1]
 The painting itself depicts a bound, crowned, bleeding Christ (center) being presented to the people by Pontius Pilate (left from center). The painting captures the moment in which Pilate announces to the crowd ""Ecce homo"" (behold the man), a line in keeping with biblical text in the gospel of John 19:5.[1] Pilate (a Roman governor) himself is depicted wearing Middle Eastern clothing in place of Roman garb, and is described by one source as having ""vaguely orientalizing costume"";[1] such depictions possibly are in reference to the-then expanding Ottoman Empire, a major geopolitical force that often clashed with Christian nations in Europe. To Christ's right is a black African, a possible reference to the Arab slave trade (which resulted in black slaves being present in the Middle East) and the Muslim domination of Africa.[2] Several scholars have also noted that, as the scene depicted in Christ takes place hours before Christ's execution, the presence of a black African is a likely continuation of the European tradition of associating black Africans with executioners.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lacemaker_(Maes),The Lacemaker (Maes),"The Lacemaker is an oil on canvas painting by the Dutch painter Nicolaes Maes, created c. 1656. It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.
 This painting is typical of many paintings of women in interiors painted by Maes in the time.[1] The woman is making bobbin lace using a lace pillow that can be seen in other Maes paintings of lacemakers:
 The child in a highchair was a popular subject for many Dutch genre painters, and this painting shows how it was used as a safe place to play as well as for eating. The empty bowl of porridge is on the floor along with some other items the boy has let fall. He is wearing a red valhoed or falling cap, which seems to indicate that confinement in the chair is necessary if any lacemaking is going to get done.
Some other 17th-century examples of paintings of children with their high chairs:
 This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1914, who wrote; ""75. A Young Lace-Maker. Sm. Suppl. 13. She wears a red dress and white apron, and sits at a window which lights the room. Beside her, her little child, in a yellow frock, plays in a wooden chair.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flower_Girl_(Ingham),The Flower Girl (Ingham),"The Flower Girl is a mid 19th-century painting by Irish-American artist Charles Cromwell Ingham. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a young woman holding a bouquet of flowers. The painting is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Inghram painted Flower Girl in 1846. Though the original commissioner of the painting is not known, sources speculate it was painted for Jonathan Sturges, who owned the painting when it was first displayed in 1847.[1] The model who sat for Inghram is not known, though one source speculates it was a Marie Perkins of New Orleans.[2]
 Like many contemporaneous paintings, Flower Girl depicts a street vendor. Inghram had previously rendered paintings of street vendors, but Flower is unusual among his works in that it portrays a young girl in place of a young boy. According to the Met's description of the painting, Inghram may have been inspired to paint a flower girl by a similar (and notably popular) painting of the same name by 17th century painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo.[1]
 As far as painting elements are concerned, Inghram's Flower Girl makes effective use of colors and direction; the titular flower girl's bouquet is made up of a number of different flowers, while her gaze is fixed directly on the viewer. The girl holds in her right hand a potted fuchsia, a traditional symbol of the Roman goddess Flora and of frustrated love.[1] Inghram's signature can be seen on the flower basket's handle.[2]
 The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the painting in 1902 as a gift from William Church Osborn, a New York lawyer who would eventually become president of the Met from 1941 to 1947.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_(Trumbull),George Washington (Trumbull),"George Washington, also entitled George Washington and William Lee, is a full-length portrait in oil painted in 1780 by the American artist John Trumbull during the American Revolutionary War.[1] General George Washington stands near his enslaved servant William Lee, overlooking the Hudson River in New York, with West Point and ships in the background. Trumbull, who once served as an aide-de-camp to Washington, painted the picture from memory while studying under Benjamin West in London. He finished it before his arrest for high treason in November.[2][3] The portrait, measuring 36 in × 28 in (0.91 m × 0.71 m), is on view in Gallery 753 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Originally in the possession of the de Neufville family of the Netherlands, it was bequeathed to the museum by Charles Allen Munn in 1924.[1][2]
 Trumbull served in the Continental Army as a second aide-de-camp to General Washington from July 27 to August 15, 1775. Later commissioned colonel, he resigned due to a dispute over his service time on February 22, 1777. After that, he resumed his career as a painter in Boston. In May 1780, he travelled to Nantes, France for business, but after this was unsuccessful, went to London in July to study painting under Benjamin West.[2][4] West's first question was whether Trumbull had brought any of his paintings to show his skill. Since he had no examples, he began by copying gallery paintings.[5] Subsequently, Trumbull painted this portrait of Washington from memory and probably gave it to Leendert de Neufville, son of Jean de Neufville.[2][6]
 On November 15, 1780, news of the treason of Benedict Arnold and the death of Major John André reached London. On November 20, Trumbull was arrested for high treason and then imprisoned at Tothill Fields Bridewell.[3][7] Nearly seven months later, on June 12, 1781, he was released and ordered to leave the country within thirty days.[8] On July 13, by then in Amsterdam, he wrote to his father that he was staying at the home of de Neufville.[9] On July 20, he wrote of his plans to return home aboard the frigate South Carolina, commanded by Commodore Alexander Gillon. The voyage lasted six months, arriving at Boston in January 1782.[10][11]
 The painting remained in the possession of the de Neufville family until 1890. It was sold through art dealers in London, and acquired by the New York art dealer Edward G. Kennedy before 1898.  By 1908, the painting was in the collection of Charles Allen Munn, who bequeathed it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1924.[1]
 Washington, in full military uniform, a blue coat over buff waistcoat and pants, is shown brightly lit in the center of a landscape, standing on a hill overlooking the Hudson River in New York. In the background, West Point is visible on the left, with a red and white striped banner flying, perhaps the First Navy Jack. Washington holds a hat, sword, and scrolled document. A red turbaned Black servant, usually identified as William ""Billy"" Lee, attends Washington's horse in the right foreground. Smoke rises from ships on the river in the lower right background.[1][2][12][13]
 The likeness of Washington may be influenced by Charles Willson Peale's c. 1776 portrait of Washington, which Trumbull had copied in Boston in 1778, and which is now in the Brooklyn Museum.  The composition shows influences from other paintings of military men with a groom and horse, back to Anthony van Dyck's c. 1635 painting Charles I at the Hunt.  Some aspects, such as the reinforcement of outlines with black, echo the techniques of Benjamin West.[2]
 British engraver and print publisher, Valentine Green, created a mezzotint version entitled General Washington. It was published by appointment of de Neufville, January 15, 1781. The legend includes a cartouche at the bottom showing a Native American holding the Washington family crest.[13][14] In 1783, he created a half-length portrait, also entitled General Washington. In 1782, Jacques Le Roy engraved a version entitled G. Washington, with the image reversed.[15]
 
Munn in his book, Three Types of Washington Portraits, states:  
The popularity of the portrait was very great. It was the first authentic portrait of Washington that had been published in Europe, and copies of it were soon issued in France and elsewhere.[16] 
In the Yale University Art Gallery catalogue, John Trumbull: The Hand and Spirit of a Painter, the portrait is described:  
Although still careful and restrained, the execution here is looser, recession in space more convincing, and the wooden quality observable in the faces of his earlier sitters has given way to a softer modeling.[17] A seven-cent postage stamp of Washington based on this painting, printed using black ink, was issued as part of the Washington Bicentennial stamps of 1932 by the United States Post Office.[18][19] In 1925, the painting was featured on page one of The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, and described in the article ""The Charles Allen Munn Bequest"".[20]

 Set in a mid 17th century Dutch village, Drawing the Eel depicts a number of people attending a wintertime festival. The crowd is congregated around a structure (presumed to be an inn), watching children partake in an activity - commonly known as palingtrekken, or eel pulling  - in which an eel strung on a line is plucked down by riders passing on horseback. The painting has been remarked[1] upon for its heavy inclusion of the sky (taking up two-thirds of the painting) and for van Ruysdael's excellent use of blue as a color.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoration_of_the_Shepherds_(Mantegna),Adoration of the Shepherds (Mantegna),"The Adoration of the Shepherds is a painting by the northern Italian Renaissance artist Andrea Mantegna, dated to c. 1450-1451.
 This small painting is generally attributed to Mantegna's youth. It was likely commissioned by Borso d'Este during the artist's stay in Ferrara in 1450–1451.
 The work, originally on panel, was subsequently moved to canvas at an unknown date, losing a small section on the far right. It is perhaps mentioned in a 1586 inventory of Margherita Gonzaga d'Este's possessions as a ""Prosepio de Andrea Mantegna"" (""Nativity Scene of Andrea Mantegna""). By 1603 it was owned by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, who kept it in the Villa Aldobrandini, and then it passed to his descendants. Later it was inherited by the Pamphilj, and then by the Borghese. In 1792 it was sold to the painter-dealer Alexander Day, who took it to London. William Buchanan sold it to Richard Payne Knight at Downton Castle, Herefordshire; his eventual heirs sold it to Joseph Duveen. In 1925 it was acquired from Duveen, New York, by Clarence Mackay; it was purchased for the Metropolitan Museum of Art by an anonymous donor.[1]
 The scene is set in an open space, with the Madonna in the middle, adoring the Child while kneeling on a stony area within a crumbling wall, while to her right St. Joseph is sleeping, and to her left two shepherds pray. St. Joseph's sleep may hint at his role as mere guardian of the Virgin and the Child. The blasted tree on which he leans has born fruit on a single branch; the usual interpretation of this traditional feature is of the mystic renewal of Nature under the new dispensation. Jesus' three-quarters depiction is typical of Mantegna's production. Twelve cherubs, borne on a cloud, surround the Virgin and cradle the Child.
 Behind the Virgin, to the left, are depicted boards of the ruinous stable in which Jesus was born, according to tradition. On the right is a wide landscape, framed by two steep mountains. Two other shepherds are represented in the right background, and a third on the road next to the river, each one met by an angel (bearing the news). A big tree somewhat resembling the Calvary Cross presages Jesus' Passion. There is also an ox, a traditional mute witness of the Nativity. Faint traces of the traditional ass may be glimpsed in the darkness within the stable doorway. The prominent gourd hanging on the wattle fence is a Christian symbol representing the Resurrection and also referring to pilgrimage.[2]
 Several flaws in the perspective have induced scholars to assign this work to a date near that of the first frescoes executed by Mantegna in the Ovetari Chapel, in particular to the first scenes of the Life of St. James  (1448-1450). The attention to detail has been explained by the influence of the Flemish School, which Mantegna could study in the Este family collection, perhaps through a direct knowledge of Rogier van der Weyden. The grotesque portraits of the shepherds, such as their wrinkles and other realistic details, show the influence of northern European examples.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ameya,The Ameya,"The Ameya, also known as The Candy Blower, is a late 19th-century painting by American artist Robert Frederick Blum. Done in oil on canvas, the illustration depicts a Japanese candy maker (practicing the art of Amezaiku) at work. The Ameya is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 In 1890, Scribner’s Magazine dispatched American painter Robert Frederick Blum to Japan to illustrate a series of articles (written by Sir Edwin Arnold)[1] the magazine was publishing. Blum occupied a small house in Tokyo for two years, and traveled through the country in search of scenes to illustrate.[2][1]
 The Ameya was created by Blum during the later period of his stay in Japan. The work depicts an ameya, a candy maker practicing the art of Amezaiku; Blum himself described the ameya's work as being akin to glassblowing.[2]
 Following his return to the United States, Blum's work was well received, particularly at the 1893 exhibition of the National Academy of Design[3]—Blum later credited The Ameya with securing his election to the Academy.[4] A critic for the New York Times praised the work's use of multiple subjects in varied dress, and described it as being ""admirably painted"".[3] Other sources have cited Ameya as being an example of Blum's ability to convincingly render groups of figures in his illustrations.[3]
 The painting was once owned by Alfred Corning Clark, whose estate donated it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1904.[2]

The fixture was organised by Llewelyn Kenrick, who had founded the Football Association of Wales only a few weeks earlier. The Welsh team was selected after trial matches were held at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham, Wales. Scotland, the more experienced team, dominated the match and had several chances to score in the first half. They had a goal disallowed after scoring directly from a corner kick, before taking the lead after 40 minutes through John Ferguson. In the early stages of the second half, Wales attempted to play more openly to find a goal, but the Scottish side took advantage of their opponent's inexperience and scored two further goals. Scotland added a fourth through Henry McNeil and claimed a victory in front of a crowd of around 17,000 people, a record for an international fixture at the time. (Full article...)

 Ulysses S. Grant (1822–1885) was the 18th President of the United States (1869–77). He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and retired after serving in the Mexican–American War. When the Civil War began in 1861, he rejoined the U.S. Army and won major victories at Shiloh and Vicksburg, and in the Chattanooga campaign. After promotion to Commanding General, Grant confronted Robert E. Lee in a series of bloody battles in Virginia in 1864, trapping Lee's army in the siege of Petersburg. Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, ended the war. After the war, he implemented Congressional Reconstruction. Elected president in 1868, Grant led the Republicans in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism, protect African American citizenship, and support economic prosperity nationwide. In foreign policy, Grant sought to increase American trade and influence, while remaining at peace with the world. His presidency has often come under criticism for tolerating corruption and, in his second term, leading the nation into an economic depression. After an unsuccessful attempt at nomination for a third term in 1880, he completed his memoirs, garnering critical acclaim and financial success.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9lizaire_and_the_Frey_Children,Bélizaire and the Frey Children,"Bélizaire and the Frey Children is an 1837 group portrait painting attributed to the artist Jacques Amans that is a rare example of an enslaved person who is painted in a naturalistic manner.[1][2] It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.[1]
 The painting shows the enslaved Afro-Creole teenager Bélizaire together with the three children of the New Orleans merchant and banker Frederick Frey.[3]
 Frey's family purchased Bélizaire (b. 1822) and his mother, an enslaved woman named Sallie, when Bélizaire was six.[3][4] He was born in approximately 1822, so would have been about 15 years old when the portrait was painted. In 1856 Bélizaire was sold to be enslaved on the Evergreen Plantation, a sugar plantation in Louisiana, and researchers have been unable to determine what happened to him after 1860. The painting is the only known image that exists of one of the 400 persons who were enslaved at the Evergreen Plantation.[5][2]
 Two of the Frey children in the painting died the same year it was painted,[3] and the other did not survive to adulthood.[5]
 Around the turn of the 20th century, a member of the Frey family had the figure of Bélizaire painted out of the composition. When the family donated it to the New Orleans Museum of Art in 1972, the museum was informed that an enslaved person had been painted out, but no action was taken by the museum.[2]
 The painting was deaccessioned  from the museum's collection in 2005, and the acquirer removed the overpaint.[5]
 The collector Jeremy K. Simien purchased the painting in 2021. Simien had it further restored by Craig Crawford, who removed remaining overpaint. (Crawford had earlier restored another New Orleans painting where lace had been painted over because a restorer had incorrectly determined that the subject would not have worn lace, because of her race.[6])  Simien also commissioned the historian Katy Morlas Shannon to research Bélizaire's identity and history, thus recovering his name and year of birth which was previously unrecorded in the museum documentation.[2]
 The painting is the ""first naturalistic portrait of a named Black subject set in a Southern landscape"" in the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum.[3] Its display is part of a national trend in museums and Southern historic sites to ""address their history of slavery and how ... wealth was accumulated"".[5]

Rises on our view amid a crashing roar
That bids us kneel, and Times great God adore.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Carrying_the_Cross_(El_Greco,_New_York)","Christ Carrying the Cross (El Greco, New York)","Christ Carrying the Cross is an oil painting by El Greco, produced early in his Toledo period circa de 1580.[1]  The picture depicts Christ in a moment of personal reflection as he carries the cross to his death, therefore committing the ultimate sacrifice for humankind. In the painting, Christ's eyes are lifted up to the heavens as he begins his walk towards his crucifixion. His gentle hands wrap around the cross as a stormy night floods the background. Christ Carrying the Cross is an oil painting, 105x79cm.[2]  The painting, one of numerous similar paintings by El Greco, is currently in the El Greco room in the New York art collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[3]
 Born in 1541 in Crete, El Greco's official name is Doménikos Theotokópoulos. [4]  El Greco acquired this name while living in Italy, no doubt studying the classical style of art. In Italy, El Greco lived in Venice, and studied under Titian, one of the most profound Italian Renaissance artists.[5]  After three years, El Greco moved from Venice to Rome to continue his studies and works under the patronage of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese.[1]  While in Rome, Greco continued to develop his own personal artistic style, combining the styles of the Byzantine era, the Renaissance era, and the Mannerist era.[6]  To read a full version of El Greco's life, history, and artistic style click here.
 Because he combined the stylistic ideas of three different eras and conceptions of art, El Greco's paintings were truly unique. Overall, they captivated a new essence about the idea of the body. Greco's figures often were lengthy, elongated forms that felt almost fluid in nature.[7]  His painting usually carried the notion of Romanticism, focusing on the suffering and love through pain and contention.[6]  El Greco also was inspired by the techniques and ideals of the Renaissance period, specifically the idea that a perfect human body was a pure connection to the divine.[8]  Most of Greco's works featured figures that related to this divine and iconoclastic sense of being. However, El Greco's figures were often distorted and elongated, contrasting the sheer proportionate perfection of the Renaissance bodily form.[8]  Instead, his paintings and works connected to a divine presence by through strong, visual, emotional appeals. This reflection of strong and purposeful emotion stems from the Mannerist age, captivating the idea of an aggressive, emotional, and almost violent perspective and strong emotional whirlwind to captive the narration and feeling behind the piece.[9] This was often the structural layout in most of Greco's works.
 El Greco also found the use of color to be of absolute importance.[10]  Establishing an aesthetic color palette was sometimes more important than the actual figure itself. Greco often had a tendency to use deep, full, rich colors to motivate the emotional expression in the piece to affect the viewers mood. The saturated hues of navy, black, purple, and red allowed for the viewer to  be taken to another dimension. Greco's use of color captivates a sense of wrathfulness and divine devotion that seems other worldly.
 The main idea of Greco's painting style was to dramatize the narration, emotion, and message of each piece. El Greco often used oil paints on canvas.[4]
 The painting, Christ Carrying the Cross, had been owned by Sir William Stirling Maxwell (1818–1878), General Archibald Stirling, and Lieutenant Colonel William Stirling. In 1953 it was acquired by Robert Lehman, and in 1975 it was acquired as part of his collection by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
 It is on view in the Met museum's Gallery 958.[2]
 In Christ Carrying the Cross, there are a multitude of minute details that help narrate the raw, expressive emotion of the work. Overall, the aching look in Christ's eyes show both a plea for mercy and an understanding of what is to come. The painting itself was inspired by and parallels Michelangelo's Risen Christ.[5]  The work also relates directly to the Northern Italian narration of the way to calvary. This narration allows the artist to express the human emotions of Christ rather than his projected divine expression.[11]  In this work, the Northern Italian per
narration allows Christ to beg for mercy while also having an understanding of his role in God's plan to forgive humankind for their sins. In addition to Christ's emotional expression, the Northern Italian narration of the crucifixion story allowed Christ to be an isolated being, separated from the whirlwind of the crowd surrounding his crucifixion.[2]
 On the way to calvary, Christ is carrying the cross to his own crucifixion in Jerusalem.[12] This painting depicts a moment along the way where Christ stops amid a storm to communicate and reflect to the heavens before committing the ultimate sacrifice for humankind.
 Many of the emotional details in this piece are shown in Christ himself. Below is a table elaborating on a few details from the painting that assist with the narration of the piece.[13]
 https://www.elgreco.net/christ-carrying-the-cross.jsp
 The background of Christ Carrying the Cross is an overwhelming storm: lightning, thunder, and possible rain. The clouds gather in dark hues to darken the mood and narration of the piece. Usually, storms are associated with feelings of fear and unease: both feelings that are highly applicable to the human nature of this portrait. The storm clouds also have breaks of light, allowing the viewer to understand Christ's acceptance of his sacrifice as he communicates and reflects with the heavens.
 Often, Christ imagery is associated with a biblical passage or text. In this case, the background illustrates Matthew 8:23-27.[15] In this text, Christ reminds the disciples of their faith, even in moments of struggle and fear. This same narration is shown in Christ Carrying the Cross. Although the storm seems to be raging in the background in a moment of death, Christ reminds us that God is with us and is with him at all times. There is no need to have doubt or fear in the eyes of the Lord.
 This painting is a prime example of religious imagery. Not only does the work feature Christ, a religious, iconoclastic figure, but it also displays an array of biblical passages and narratives throughout the work. As mentioned earlier, the background of the piece demonstrates Matthew 8:23-27.[15] The actual narration of the crucifixion is written about in all four gospels of the Bible: Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John.

 The work was one of a series of 35 oil paintings that Courbet produced in quick succession during the fall of 1865. Unlike many other marine paintings of that time, the boat is the central feature of the composition rather than a minor element. The Fishing Boat was the first work by Courbet to enter the Met's collection when it was acquired in 1899.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entombment_of_Christ_(Carracci),Entombment of Christ (Carracci),"Entombment of Christ is a c.1595 oil on copper painting by Annibale Carracci, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art[1]
 According to Giovanni Pietro Bellori and Carlo Cesare Malvasia, Annibale Carracci's main 17th-century biographers, the painting was produced for Astorre Sampieri, an important clergyman in Bologna. Malvasia adds the details that it was a painting on copper and that Sampieri commissioned it to give to a major but unnamed figure in Rome but thought so highly of it that he kept the original for itself and instead gave the figure a (now lost) copy made by Carracci's then pupil Guido Reni. It is usually dated to around 1595, the year in which Annibale, his cousin Ludovico and his brother Agostino completed the Palazzo Sampieri frescoes for Sampieri, complemented by Annibale's own Christ and the Samaritan Woman.[2]
 Several copies of the work survive, particularly by Sisto Badalocchio, leading scholars to theorise that there must be a lost original of the composition by Carracci himself.[2] The work reappeared on the art market and was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum in 1998 as another Badalocchio copy,[3] only later being reattributed to Carracci himself.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dead_Christ_with_Angels,The Dead Christ with Angels,"The Dead Christ with Angels is an 1864 oil painting by French painter Édouard Manet. The painting depicts the biblical story (John 20:12) of Mary Magdalene entering the tomb of Jesus and seeing two angels but finding Jesus's body missing.[1][2] It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
 Manet seldom chose to paint images with religious meaning, and he tended to focus on contemporary subjects. John Hunisak speculates that Manet may have wanted to display a religious work in the 1864 Salon because of the negative reaction he had received for his recent paintings of modern subjects.[3] Manet may have hoped, Hunisak suggests, that the more traditional topic, with a contemporary twist, would please his supporters and critics alike.
 This work sparked controversy and confusion among viewers due to certain stylistic choices Manet made in representing the story.
 Most notably, Manet shows the two angels with the body of the dead Christ still visible.[4] The Bible verses referenced describe the angels dressed in white, however Manet's choice was to depict them dressed in bright red and orange colors. Vladimir Gurewich suggests that this decision was most likely meant to heighten the drama of the scene.[4]
 A stone in the lower right section of the painting is inscribed with the chapter in the Gospel of John that the work is based upon. The direct verse reference is debated due to the style that the lowercase v is written in: it either refers to the Roman numeral V, or as an abbreviation for vers (""verse"").[2] Depending on this interpretation, the painting is a depiction of either John 20:5-12 or John 20:12.[citation needed]
 Jesus's spear wound is also shown on the wrong side of his body, which Manet realized only after he had submitted the painting to the Salon.[2] Art historians have drawn attention to the shifted wound as a mirrored image of Christ, however historical accounts note that this change was completely unintentional on the artist's part.[5] Therefore, the reading of the wound as a deeper, ""mirrored"" meaning is merely speculative interpretation.
 Critics and many of Manet's supporters were confused by the new artistic direction that he took in the painting. The contradictions within The Dead Christ with Angels are characteristic of Manet's earlier exploration of discordances: the brightly colored angels contrast with the neutral background; the angels are not aligned; and the cloth is variously realistic and abstract.[3]: 271  The technique used to paint Jesus, most notably the blurring seen in his hand and feet, also shows movement typical of Manet's work.[3] Despite the similarities in technique, the scene attracted attention due to its lack of alignment with Manet's previous works.[citation needed]
 In 1866 or 1867 Manet produced an etching with aquatint of the painting. Impressions are in many collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago and the Cleveland Museum of Art.
 The Dead Christ with Angels is often associated with the book Vie de Jésus by Ernest Renan, published in 1863, a year before Manet's painting was first exhibited. In the book, Renan denies Christ's resurrection from the dead, and emphasizes the idea that miracles do not exist.[6] Renan's work is credited as a potential influence for Manet because the inscribed verse, John 20:12, served as the book's main argument in the denial of Christ's resurrection. The painting also shows the angels grieving over death instead of happily announcing a resurrection, which is often used as proof to demonstrate the artistic influence Renan had on Manet.[6]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudy_Mountains,Cloudy Mountains,"Cloudy Mountains (Chinese: 雲山圖) are a set of two paintings of the same name created by Chinese Song dynasty artist, Mi Youren (1072-1151), son of painter Mi Fu. [1][2]
 Utilizing a technique called ""ink play"" or ""Mi dots"" (Mi Dian), Mi Youren adapted the style of his father, which involved blots of wet ink blots, moist brushes, and horizontal strokes to lay out a blurry, yet simplified mountain landscape, which represented the rainy climate of Henan Province.[1][3][4]
 The subsequent techniques of Chinese landscape paintings, would have substantial influence in the Ming dynasty, as well as Muromachi Period art in Japan, including artists like Sesshū.[3]
 One painting is currently held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the other is held by the Cleveland Museum of Art, the latter being Cleveland's oldest dated Chinese painting.[1][2]
 Mi Youren, whose grandmother was the wet nurse of Song Dynasty emperor Yingzong, was involved in the imperial administrations like his father Mi Fu, who took on the position of military governor in Wuwei as well as secretary for the Ministry of Rites.[4] He is likely either of Xianbei descent, through the Kumo Xi tribe and/or of Sogdian descent, as the surname Mi (米) is considered a Sogdian surname.[5][6]
 In addition to being a scholar and an artist, Mi Youren authenticated ancient paintings under Emperor Huizong, and also served as a vice president for the Ministry of War.[1] He also has combat experience in the Jin–Song Wars.[2][7]
 The MET specimen (1973.121.1) is representative of the divergence between the simplified Southern Song style that Mi Fu innovated versus Northern Song styles, which placed emphasis on detailed landscape.[1] Painted in the 1140s, while under the service of Emperor Gaozong, the ""cloudy mountain"" motif became his artistic interpretation of what good governance is.

 Subsequent colophons annotating the painting, one piece written by Wang Jie (王介) in 1200 would describe how Mi Youren would produce the paintings for Gaozong, who would then gift it to his courtiers.[1][8]
 The MET painting enjoyed extensive provenance history, as though the image itself only occupied 57 cm in length, subsequent mountings and annotations extended the scroll to 747.2 cm in length. [1] The painting was passed through the Qing dynasty emperors up til the end of the dynasty. [1]
 
The Cleveland Painting is one of the Cleveland Museum of Art's oldest dated Chinese painting, acquired in 1933.[2] It depicts the misty riverscape of the Yangtze Delta. [2] As a result of the turmoil during the Jin-Song war, Mi Youren fled the scene where upon the encounter of the landscape, he painted this piece on September 11, 1130.[2][7] Written on the landscape was:  好山無數接天涯，烟靄陰晴日夕佳。 要識先生會到此，故留筆戲在君家。 庚戍歲，辟地新昌作。元暉。 [seal] 元暉戲作
 
 
Fine hills are endless toward the edges of heaven. So are mist and cloud, rain and shine, days and nights. Had I known that you’d be visiting here. I would have left this playful work in your home. In the year of gengxu [1130], [I painted this] while seeking refuge in Xinchang. Yuanhui. [seal] “Yuan hui xi zuo” (Yuanhui playfully made this). [2] Mi Youren and his family evacuated Runzhou (潤洲) as the Jurchens sieged Kaifeng, to Jintan (金壇,), and subsequently evacuated to the town of Xinchang (新昌村) as bandits and the Jurchens advanced through Jiangnan (江南).[7]
 Subsequently after acquisition at Cleveland, it was on special exhibit in the Royal Academy of Arts in the 1935-1936 International Exhibition of Chinese Art.[2]
 In a study conducted by the Beijing University of Technology and Hongik University, the painting's blur and haze was utilized in a study in cognitive neuroscience and neuroesthetics, wherein the visual impressions and sensation of emotions and good feelings are triggered brushstrokes and blurs utilized in the landscape.[10]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Iris_(painting),Black Iris (painting),"Black Iris, formerly called Black Iris III,[1][2] is a 1926 oil painting by Georgia O'Keeffe.[3] Art historian Linda Nochlin interpreted Black Iris as a morphological metaphor for female genitalia.[4][5] O'Keeffe rejected such interpretations in a 1939 text accompanying an exhibition of her work, in which she wrote: ""Well—I made you take time to look at what I saw and when you took time to really notice my flower you hung all your own associations with flowers on my flower and you write about my flower as if I think and see what you think and see of the flower—and I don't.""[6] She attempted to do away with sexualized readings of her work by adding a lot of detail.[7]
 It was first exhibited at the Intimate Gallery, New York from January 11 to February 27, 1927, where it was catalogued as DARK IRIS NO. 3.[8] Unlike her previous shows, this show was largely devoid of the colourful paintings for which she had received critical acclaim.[9] Lewis Mumford commented: ""Yesterday O'Keeffe's exhibition opened … the show is strong: one long, loud blast of sex, sex in youth, sex in adolescence, sex in maturity, sex as gaudy as ""Ten Nights in a Whorehouse,"" and sex as pure as the vigils of the vestal virgins, sex bulging, sex tumescent, sex deflated. After this description you'd better not visit the show: inevitably you'll be a little disappointed. For perhaps only half the sex is on the walls; the rest is probably in me.""[10]  The painting remained in the collection of the artist from 1926 to 1969. It was on extended loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1949 to 1969, when it was donated as part of the Alfred Stieglitz Collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[3] The painting's title changed in 1991 from Black Iris III to Black Iris when the list of her works was revised.[11]
 The picture was in use on several episodes of The Handmaid's Tale in season 3. (Source: End credits of the show)
 O'Keeffe uses a variety of colors in order to create Black Iris, although her focus is on darker shades. She implements black, purple, and maroon to detail the center and lower petals of the iris, while using pink, gray, and white when detailing the upper petals of the flower. O'Keeffe blends outwardly in order to soften the outer edges of the painting. With the use of white and other bright colors, she is able to bring light into the image, despite the lack of a light source. O'Keeffe was intent on light and its importance in presenting the organic beauty of her subjects. Her art demonstrates her belief in the inner vitalism of nature and her association of this force with light.[failed verification][13]
 O'Keeffe began painting the centres of flowers in 1924.[14][15] The first show of her enlarged flowers was at the Anderson Galleries in 1926.[16] The black irises were a recurring subject: She painted another oil called The Black Iris (CR 558), also known as  The Dark Iris No. II and Dark Iris, a small (9x7"") oil in 1926.[17] In 1927,  she also created Dark Iris No. III, a pastel on paper.[14] Iris, from 1929 is a 32x12"" is in the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. She returned to the black iris in 1936, with Black Iris II [Black Iris VI, 1936] (36x24"").[18]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Blessing_Jacob_(Gerbrand_van_den_Eeckhout),Isaac Blessing Jacob (Gerbrand van den Eeckhout),"Isaac Blessing Jacob is a 1642 religious painting by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout. It shows Jacob kneeling at the bed of his blind father Isaac under the watchful eye of his mother Rebecca as he receives his brother Esau's blessing. It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[1]
 The painting shows the biblical story quite literally, with Jacob wearing his older brother's ""best jacket"" (which is too large) and his hands and neck have been covered in goatskin.[2] On his back is a hunting quiver of arrows, but on the floor is a bow that has its string loose, indicating that it couldn't have been used in its current state. On a side table covered with a carpet, a still-life arrangement with napkin, salt-cellar and wine flask accompany Jacob's ""tasty goat meat"". The most prominent item on the table[3] is the ewer of the Amsterdam silversmith's guild, a famous silver object that itself shares a brotherly theme. Van Eeckhout's father was a member of the silversmith's guild, and the salt cellar could be one of his creations.
 Little is known of the early history of the painting, though it is considered an example of Van Eeckhout's dependence on Rembrandt in his early years.[4][5]  This painting came into The Met's collection via the Collis P. Huntington bequest in 1925. It was first researched in 1990 when the provenance was documented back to the sale of Elizabeth Valckenier, née Hooft (1712–96), widow of Wouter Valckenier.[5] It is probably the same painting that was sold at the Confrerie Pictura in The Hague on 24 April 1737 as a piece representing Isaac blessing his son Jacob by Gerbrand van den Eekhout.[5]
 The choice of subject by the 21-year-old son of a goldsmith who himself chose painting over engraving and smithwork is possibly related to the high regard that the artists of Amsterdam had for this memorial cup. Van Eeckhout drew it with variations as one of several examples in a print book published by Cornelis Danckert.[5]
 Van Eeckhout is also known for using the cup again, in at least four other paintings:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervara_Altarpiece,Cervara Altarpiece,"The Cervara Altarpiece or Cervara Polyptych was an oil-on-oak-panel altarpiece painted by the Flemish painter Gerard David early in the 16th century for the high altar of Cervara Abbey in Liguria, Italy.
 It was commissioned by the Genoese nobleman Vincenzo Sauli on 7 September 1506, as dated in a 17th-century document - Sauli's name is painted above the Virgin's feet in the central panel. David painted it in Bruges and it was installed in the Abbey in 1507.[1]
 It was originally formed of seven panels, which were divided up after the monastery's suppression and requisition in 1797 by the Republic of Genoa. The separated panels were initially deposited in the Palais Ducal, seat of the prefecture, and only four panels remained in Genoa. These four were the central one (measuring 153 by 89 cm and showing the Madonna and Child Enthroned or the Madonna of the Grapes), two side panels (each measuring 152.5 by 64 cm and showing saint Jerome and saint Maurus) and an upper central panel (measuring 102 by 88 cm and showing the Crucifixion).[2]
 The central Virgin and Child and the upper Crucifixion panels were rediscovered in the Palazzo Ducale in 1805. In 1830 the painter Francesco Baratta the elder supervised their transfer to the mayor's office in the Palazzo Tursi, the civic palazzo, and later into the Palazzo Bianco gallery.[3] The altarpiece's three remaining panels were later rediscovered in Italy. Two of these were the two upper side panels of the Annunciation, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, with one showing the angel and one the Virgin. A final semicircular panel from above the Crucifixion is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris - this shows God the Father with his hand raised in blessing, surrounded by angels. All seven panels were re-united at the Palazzo Bianco in autumn 2005.[4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harvesters_(painting),The Harvesters (painting),"
 The Harvesters is an oil painting on wood completed by Pieter Bruegel the Elder in 1565. It depicts the harvest time set in a landscape, in the months of July and August or late summer.[1] Nicolaes Jonghelinck, a merchant banker and art collector from Antwerp, commissioned this painting as part of a cycle of six paintings depicting various seasonal transitions during the year.[1]
 The painting is one in a series of six (or perhaps twelve) works, five of which are still extant, that depict different times of the year.[1] As in many of his paintings, the focus is on peasants and their work and does not have the religious themes common in landscape works of the time.[1] Notably, some of the peasants are shown eating while others are harvesting wheat, a depiction of both the production and consumption of food.[2] Pears can be seen on the white cloth in front of the upright sitting woman who eats bread and cheese while a figure in the tree to the far right picks pears. The painting shows a large number of activities representative of the 16th-century Belgian rural life.[3] For example, on the far right a person is shaking apples from the tree. In the center left of the painting, a group of villagers can be seen participating in the blood sport of cock throwing.[4] The painting has been at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City since 1919.[5] The Metropolitan Museum of Art calls this painting a “watershed in the history of Western art”[1] and the “first modern landscape”.[6] A sense of distance is conveyed by the workers carrying sheaves of wheat through the clearing, the people bathing in the pond, the children playing and the ships far away.
 
The surviving Months of the Year cycle are: The Gloomy Day, The Hunters in the Snow, and The Return of the Herd are on display in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The Hay Harvest is on display in the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague. The Harvesters is at the Metropolitan Museum in New York.
 Legendary animation director, Hayao Miyazaki took inspiration from this painting for his short film Mr. Dough and the Egg Princess.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_Traders_Descending_the_Missouri,Fur Traders Descending the Missouri," Fur Traders Descending the Missouri is an 1845 painting by George Caleb Bingham. It is one of his most famous paintings, and is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He had brought it to St. Louis, Missouri on June 4, 1845, along with several other pieces of artwork. 
 It was painted around 1845 in the style called luminism by some historians of American art, and was originally titled French-Trader, Half-breed Son. The American Art Union thought the title potentially controversial and renamed it when it was first exhibited. It reflects the reality of fur traders' common marriages with Native American women, which resulted in the formation of the Métis ethnic group in Canada. The father's toque cap suggests that he is a voyageur of French descent.  A black fox is in the front of the canoe, with pointed ears, long, sharp snout, and tongue.  Black fox pelts were the most expensive, and therefore most desirable, furs of the time. Many Native American tribes regarded black foxes as spiritually symbolic creatures.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_9:45_Accommodation,The 9:45 Accommodation,"The 9:45 Accommodation is a 19th-century painting by American artist Edward Lamson Henry. Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts a train being boarded. Several notable versions of the painting have been produced, the first being an 1864 painting on wood panel and the second being an 1867 oil on canvas painting. The original 1864 work is in the collection of the Morse Museum of American Art,[1] while the 1867 work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[2]
 Henry painted his original 9:45 in 1864 using oil paint on wood panel. This earliest painting is in the collection of the Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Florida. The museum's first director, Hugh F. McKean, once described 9:45 as a painting that ""has won the hearts of many Americans.""[1]
 A second, widely reproduced version of the painting was painted by Henry for American businessman John Taylor Johnston, president of the New Jersey Central Railroad. Johnston also served as the first President of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where the 1867 painting is on display.[2]
 Edward Lamson Henry, a noted genre painter, was deeply interested in transportation.[2] This interest included trains, a key part of 19th century America's infrastructure. As noted by the Met's description of the work, the model of train station depicted in the 1867 painting was widely produced, rendering the exact station hard to identify.[2] Per the museum, Henry may have also used elements from multiple stations in his depiction of a bustling station.[2]

 The painting depicts a Woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), a large wading bird that includes the Indian subcontinent in its range.[1] Done in watercolor on European paper, the work was produced by an unknown Indian artist, in what is known as the Company style. The work is traceable to a series of 658 paintings of birds that the French-born Major-General Claude Martin commissioned for his private collection.[2][3]
 The way in which the painting is executed implies that the anonymous author was familiar with the Woolly-necked stork; notably, the stork is shown to be crossing its right foot over its left, the standard posture of a stork.[3]

 Esther Before Ahasuerus is a painting by the 17th-century Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi. It shows the biblical heroine Esther going before Ahasuerus to beg him to spare her people. The painting is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, having been donated to the museum by Elinor Dorrance Ingersoll in 1969.[1] It is one of Gentileschi's lesser known works, but her use of lighting, characterization, and style help in successfully portraying Esther as a biblical heroine as well as the main protagonist of the work.[citation needed]
 The painting is not specifically dated and the patron or the commissioner of the painting is still unknown. Scholars of Baroque art and Artemisia Gentileschi hold various opinions over when the painting was created; many believe that Esther Before Ahasuerus was painted during the 1630s, during Artemisia's first Neapolitan period.[1]
 Artemisia Gentileschi was one of the only women in the Baroque period who was given the training and ability to become a skilled painter, and became one of the most prominent painters of this era because of this.[1]
 Artemisia was the eldest child of artist Orazio Gentileschi and was trained in her father's workshop along with her brothers, showing more talent than any of them.[2] She was trained in the style of Caravaggio, as her father's style took inspiration from his.[2][3] Artemisia's works tend to reflect that training and as such are similar in style to Caravaggio's, but with less focus on dramatic setting and lighting seen in his works and more focus on the people involved and their characterizations. Her paintings are also less idealistic in portraying people and more naturalistic and even a bit mischievous, which can be seen in Esther Before Ahasuerus where Esther is painted to look more like a normal woman rather than an idealized one, while Ahasuerus is made to look more comedic than a king would normally be depicted.
 The scene in the painting is from the Book of Esther and depicts Esther, the Jewish wife of the king Ahasuerus (sometimes named as Xerxes in modern texts). After the king ordered the execution of all Jewish people in the Persian Empire, Esther went before him, without being summoned, to beg for him to spare her people. This broke court etiquette and Esther risked death in doing so. She ended up fainting before the king – the moment depicted in Gentileschi's work.[1] Her action ended up softening the king's decision, and he permitted the Jews to defend themselves against his attack, preventing them from being killed off.
 While the subject matter depicted in this work is the biblical scene of Esther going before Ahasuerus to plead for her people, the style of the clothing and setting is more contemporary. The significance of the way Gentileschi depicts both Esther and the king speaks to her style and ideals. Esther is shown in better lighting, while Ahasuerus is in shadow, and the king is also depicted with an extravagant feathered hat and fur-trimmed boots that are also bejeweled. Esther, meanwhile, is depicted in more elegant and refined clothing. Gentileschi marks her as the protagonist of the scene in this way and gives her more agency while conveying the message of how much of a biblical heroine Esther is.[3]
 The colors in this piece are generally more muted and not very vibrant. Shades of red run throughout much of the background, darkened by brown to come off as shadows. The king Ahasuerus also has red in his outfit in the sash that he wears over his neck. Because of this, Esther's vibrantly yellow dress stands out in comparison to the rest of the painting, bringing attention to her figure. She is also better lit than the king, who is almost in shadow. His color palette is also different from the background with an outfit of white and dark green, but unlike Esther, he does not stand out as much due to the fact that he is in darker colors.
 The usage of angles in this piece also speaks to how staged it is and represents the style of the Baroque era. Both Esther and the king are in almost parallel diagonal angles. Ahasuerus leans forward in his chair as Esther faints backwards, being caught by the women behind her. The diagonal angles in the curtains in front of and behind the king also give the effect of drawing the eye towards him as if to remind the viewer to pay attention to him, too, instead of just focusing on Esther. There is also a lot of direct contrast in how they are both posed. Esther is falling backwards, her chin receding into her neck, while Ahasuerus is leaning forward and looks like he is about to stand up, his chin jutting out towards her. This is a very dynamic scene with a lot of movement from both Esther and the king.
 In addition, Gentileschi paid a lot of attention to the folds of the fabrics as well as in Ahasuerus's boots, and she even made the stitches on the hem of Esther's dress so exact that they almost look real. Gentileschi's attention to detail is also visible in the cracks of the marble ground as well as the fur trim on Ahasuerus's boots, and even in the detailing of the paws that adorn the king's chair. The materials in this painting feel almost real and tangible, which helps to make the scene even more relatable to viewers.
 Artemisia Gentileschi's paintings are often filled with images of women committing acts of violence against men, especially in her most well known painting, Judith Slaying Holofernes. As one of the only prominent women in the Baroque era, Gentileschi's work is very well known. Her consistent motifs of women having power over men and even killing them is possibly a revenge narrative linked to the fact that Gentileschi was raped by her father's friend Agostino Tassi when she was just a teen.[4] Her works also tend to have themes of men objectifying women, as seen in Susanna and the Elders. Esther Before Ahasuerus is an example of a work that conveys both of these themes.
 Artemisia was not singular in her choice to depict the theme of Esther before Ahasuerus. Other artists of the period had also painted this passage from the book of Esther. Like Artemisia, Guercino[5] shows Esther swooning and being held up by her maids. In the Apocryphal text, which Guercino most likely relied on for his depiction, Esther's relationship with the King is meant to represent Mary's unity with Christ. The pomegranate, which is embroidered on Esther's dress in Guercino's and Artemisia's paintings, also symbolize the Virgin. The fruit reference's Mary's attributes – chastity and immortality.[6]     
 Artemisia, a Caravaggisti, was also influenced by Caravaggio's works in Rome during her family's sojourn in the city and her father's personal relationship with the artist[7] Caravaggisti sensibilities can be seen in Esther Before Ahasuerus. The king gravitates towards Esther, the significant figure in the composition. The dynamic between the two figures suggests role-reversal; Esther holds the power of the monarchy, and Ahasuerus is the novice.[7]  The role-reversal seen in Artemisia's Esther Before Ahasuerus is reminiscent of Caravaggio's own use of gender ambiguity and gender-reversal in his work. It can be seen in Boy with a Basket of Fruit, in which Caravaggio depicted an effeminate young boy in a sensual manner.[8] The gender of figure of the Gorgon in Caravaggio's Medusa also seems vague. It is suggested Caravaggio drew from his own face to create the image of Medusa, placing himself as the figure of the female mythological creature.[8] Ahasuerus is characterized as a ""modish dandy of a type"", a depiction Caravaggio would use to represent ""superficiality"". In juxtaposition to the King, Esther is majestic in her swooning[7]
 Esther's muscular neck is also comparable to Michelangelo's depiction of Haman in the Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco.[7]
 Gentileschi's rendition of this scene from the Book of Esther seems to follow the description seen in the Greek additions to the original account, which was declared ca"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beeches_(painting),The Beeches (painting),"The Beeches is a mid 19th-century painting by American artist Asher Brown Durand. Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts a forested path in the Northeastern United States. Beeches has been described as one of Durand's earlier works of Naturalist art.
 The Beeches was painted by Asher Brown Durand in 1845 on behalf of Abraham Cozzens, a prominent New York art collector. The painting was heavily influenced by the work of British painter John Constable, whose work Durand had viewed during an 1840 trip to the United Kingdom. Durand's work reflects a deviation in the Hudson River School in which landscape paintings began to shift focus from dramatic natural scenes to more tranquil scenes.[1][2]
 The Beeches is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_at_the_Tea_Table,Lady at the Tea Table,"Lady at the Tea Table is a late 19th-century painting by American artist Mary Cassatt. The work, done in oil on canvas, is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[1]
 The painting depicts Mary Dickinson Riddle, Cassatt's mother's first cousin, seated at a table set with a tea service. The tea set was a gift to Cassatt's family from Riddle's daughter. The tea service is gilded blue-and-white porcelain from Canton (modern day Guangzhou) in Qing dynasty China; in the 19th century, Canton was renowned for its exports to the Western world, as the port city was one of the centers of the Old China Trade.[2][3] Lady itself was painted by Cassatt as a gift for the Riddle family. However, Riddle's daughter disliked the painting, thinking it portrayed her mother's nose as being too big, and thus the painting was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Cassatt in 1923.[1]
 The painting exemplifies much of Cassatt's unique impressionist style; much emphasis is placed on the subject's stark outline, and Mrs. Riddle's jewelry pairs with the gold gilt on the tea service. Similarly, the faint blue hues used in the background draw the eye to the deeper blues of Riddle's eyes and the porcelain. The relative simplicity of the painting's design is also comparable to orientalist art, which Cassatt was influenced by.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irises_screen,Irises screen,"Irises (紙本金地著色燕子花図, shihonkinji chakushoku kakitsubata-zu) is a pair of six-panel folding screens (byōbu) by the Japanese artist Ogata Kōrin of the Rinpa school.  It depicts an abstracted view of water with drifts of Japanese irises (Iris laevigata).  The work was probably made circa 1701–1705,[1][2] in the period of luxurious display in the Edo period known as Genroku bunka (Genroku-era culture).
 The screens were housed for over 200 years by the Nishi Honganji Buddhist temple in Kyoto.  They are now held by the Nezu Museum, and they are a National Treasure of Japan.   
 A similar pair of screens made by Ogata Kōrin about 5[3] to 12[4] years later depicting irises is held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.  All four Irises screens were displayed together for the first time in almost a century[5] in 2012 at the ""Korin: National Treasure Irises of the Nezu Museum and Eight-Bridge of The Metropolitan Museum of Art"" exhibition at the Nezu Museum.[6]
 Both screens are inspired by an episode in The Tales of Ise.[7]  In turn, copies of the screens are believed to have influenced the post-impressionist paintings of Vincent van Gogh, including his Irises.
 The screens are among the first works of Japanese painter and lacquerer Ogata Kōrin after he attained the rank of Hokkyō (法橋, “Bridge of the Dharma”), the third highest rank awarded to artists. It depicts bunches of abstracted blue Japanese irises in bloom, and their green foliage, creating a rhythmically repeating but varying pattern across the panels. The similarities of some blooms indicate that a stencil was used.  The work shows influence of Tawaraya Sōtatsu. It is typical of a new artistic school, Rin-pa (琳派), which takes its name from the last syllable of his given name.
 Kōrin adopts a very restrained palette, limited to the ultramarine blue of the flowers, the green of their foliage, and the gold background.  The work was painted with ink and colour on paper, with squares of gold leaf applied around the painted areas to create a shimmering reflective background reminiscent of water.  The deep blue was made from powdered azurite (群青, gunjō).
 Each six-panel screen measures 150.9 by 338.8 centimetres (59.4 in × 133.4 in).  The screens were probably made for the Nijō family, and were presented to the Nishi Honganji Buddhist temple in Kyoto.  They were sold by the temple in 1913.
 Kōrin made a similar work about 5[8] to 12[9] years later, another pair of six-panel screens, known as Irises at Yatsuhashi (Eight Bridges) (八橋図屏風, Yatsuhashi-zu Byōbu).  This second pair of screens has been held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City since 1953, and were last displayed in 2013.[10]
 The second pair of iris screens, circa 1710–1716, was also painted with ink and color on gold-foiled paper, and measure 163.7 by 352.4 centimetres (64.4 in × 138.7 in) each.[11]
 Unlike the earlier pair of iris screens, this later pair includes a depiction of an angular bridge, a more explicit reference to the literary work that inspired both artworks.[12]
 Both pairs of screens are inspired by an episode in The Tales of Ise, where the unnamed protagonist of the story (most likely Ariwara no Narihira) encounters the flowers near a rustic eight-plank bridge over a river. He was inspired to compose a romantic poem, a form of acrostic where the first syllable of each line spells out the Japanese word for iris, かきつばた (kakitsubata):
 から衣きつつなれにし妻しあれば     はるばる来ぬる旅をしぞおもふ
Kara koromo kitsutsu nare ni shi tsuma shi areba harubaru kinuru tabi o shi zo omouThinking of my wife [in the capital] accustomed to wearing Chinese robes, I have come so far away on this trip.(Ise Monogatari 9, also Kokin Wakashū 9:410) The screens clearly influenced the Irises paintings by Vincent van Gogh: he could never have seen the originals, which were still in Japan, but they were reproduced as woodcuts in a collection, the Kōrin Hyakuzu Kōhen.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_and_Last_Judgement_diptych,Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych,"
 The Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych (or Diptych with Calvary and Last Judgement)[1] consists of two small painted panels attributed to the Early Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck, with areas finished by unidentified followers or members of his workshop. This diptych is one of the early Northern Renaissance oil-on-panel masterpieces, renowned for its unusually complex and highly detailed iconography, and for the technical skill evident in its completion. It was executed in a miniature format; the panels are just 56.5 cm (22.2 in) high by 19.7 cm (7.8 in) wide. The diptych was probably commissioned for private devotion.
 The left-hand wing depicts the Crucifixion. It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling about in the mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. The scene is framed against an expansive and foreboding sky with a view of Jerusalem in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great Deësis of saints, apostles, clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions.[2] The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.
 The earliest surviving mention of the work appears in 1841, when scholars believed the two panels were wings of a lost triptych.[3] The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the diptych in 1933. At that time, the work was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert[4] because key areas formally resembled pages of the Turin-Milan Hours, which were then believed to be of Hubert's hand.[5] On the evidence of technique and the style of dress of the figures, the majority of scholars believe the panels are late works by Jan van Eyck, executed in the early 1430s and finished after his death. Other art historians hold that van Eyck painted the panels around the early 1420s and attribute the weaker passages to a younger van Eyck's relative inexperience.[5][6]
 Along with Robert Campin and later Rogier van der Weyden, Van Eyck revolutionised the approach towards naturalism and realism in Northern European painting during the early to mid 15th century.[7] He was the first to manipulate oils to give the close detailing that infused his figures with the high degree of realism and complexity of emotion seen in this diptych.[8] He coupled this with a mastery of glaze to create luminous surfaces with a deep perspective—most noticeable in the upper portion of the Crucifixion panel—which had not been achieved before.[9]
 In the 1420s and 1430s, when oil and panel painting were still in their infancy, vertical formats were often used for depictions of the Last Judgement, because the narrow framing particularly suited a hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast, depictions of the Crucifixion were usually presented in a horizontal format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the Crucifixion panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the Judgement narrative.[3][6] The result is a panel with the crosses rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the mid-ground, and the moving spectacle of the mourners in the foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top in the style of medieval tapestries. Art historian Otto Pächt says it ""is the whole world in one painting, an Orbis Pictus"".[10]
 In the Crucifixion panel, van Eyck follows the early 14th-century tradition of presenting the biblical episodes using a narrative technique.[11] According to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, the episodes appear as ""simultaneous, not sequential"" events.[3] Van Eyck condenses key episodes from the gospels into a single composition, each placed so as to draw the viewer's eye upward in a logical sequence.[11] This device allowed van Eyck to create a greater illusion of depth with more complex and unusual spatial arrangements.[3] In the Crucifixion panel, he uses different indicators to show the relative closeness of particular groupings of figures to Jesus. Given the size of the mourners in the foreground relative to the crucified figures, the soldiers and spectators gathered in the mid-ground are far larger than a strict adherence to perspective would allow. In the Last Judgement the damned are placed in hell in the lower mid-ground while the saints and angels are positioned higher in the upper foreground.[6] Pächt writes of this panel that the scene is ""assimilated into a single spatial cosmos"", with the archangel acting as a divider in the pictorial space between heaven and hell.[10]
 Art historians are unsure as to whether the panels were meant to be a diptych or a triptych.[12] They may have formed the outer wings of a triptych, with a since-lost panel representing the Adoration of the Magi at the centre,[13] or, as the German art historian J.D. Passavant speculated in 1841, the lost centre panel may have been a Nativity.[2] It is now thought unlikely that a lost panel could be the postulated original companion to the outer wings; such a coupling would have been very odd to painters of the 1420s and 1430s. It has also been proposed that a central piece was added later, or as Albert Châtelet writes, the central panel may have been stolen.[13][14] Art historian Erwin Panofsky believed the Crucifixion and Last Judgement panels were intended as a diptych. He argued that it would have been unusual for mere outer wings to have been given the ""sumptuous treatment"" afforded these two panels.[15] This approach is reminiscent of the medieval reliquaries.[5] Others have observed that triptychs were usually much larger works intended for public display, and they tended towards gilded and heavily inscribed frames; typically only the central panel would have been as lavishly decorated as these panels. Contemporary diptychs, in contrast, were usually produced for private devotion and were typically ungilded.[2] There is no documentary evidence for an original central panel, however, and technical examination suggests the two works were intended as wings of a diptych, then an emerging format.[16] Pächt believes there is not enough evidence to determine whether a third panel existed.[12]
 The diptych is notable for the first known naturalistic depiction of the Moon's features. It had previously been typical to show the Moon as a blank disk or crescent, or with a human face. Here, the waning gibbous Moon is shown as it would appear in the mid-morning western sky in Judea, including major features such as the Mare Imbrium and the Oceanus Procellarum.[17]
 The Crucifixion panel comprises three horizontal planes, each representing different moments from the Passion. The upper third shows the crucifixion before a view of Jerusalem; the lower two thirds detail the crowds and Jesus' followers at Golgotha (Place of the Skull).[18] Located outside the city walls amongst rock tombs and gardens, in the first century Golgotha was Jerusalem's place of execution,[19] and the visible patches of hill highlight the area's ""stony, forbidding, and lifeless"" nature.[20] The atmosphere of bleakness is reinforced by the random figures in the upper ground that scramble for a better view.[18] The gospels tell of Jesus' followers and relatives, as well as his prosecutors and assorted spectators, attending the crucifixion at Golgotha. In van Eyck's panel the former are represented in the foreground, while the latter, including High Priests and Temple Elders, are shown in the mid-ground.[20]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defense_of_Champigny,The Defense of Champigny,"
 The Defense of Champigny is a late-19th-century painting by Édouard Detaille. The painting, done in oil on canvas, depicts the Battle of Villiers during the Franco-Prussian War. The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 The Defense of Champigny depicts a scene from the Battle of Villiers (also referred to as the Battle of Champingny) during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. The battle was fought as part of a series of attempts by the French Army to disrupt the Prussian Army's siege of Paris. At Villiers, what the French intended to be a small reconnaissance sortie turned into a pitched battle with the Prussians; this fighting in turn caused thousands of casualties on both sides, the partial destruction of the villages of Villiers-sur-Marne and Champigny-sur-Marne, and the retreat of the French army to Paris.[1]
 The Franco-Prussian War, which caused the collapse of the Second French Empire, was a military and political disaster for France. In the post-war period, the idea that France should rise to meet the challenge posed by the German Empire gained traction in French society. This desire for vengeance  – revanchism –  was reflected in the art of several prominent French painters, including that of Detaille.[2][3] Such art commonly depicted the seemingly dilapidated state of the French army during the Franco-Prussian War, with the intent being to show that a revitalized national army was needed to project French power.[4][5]
 Detaille, who came from a military family, served in the French army during the Siege of Paris.[6]
 Detaille originally painted his scene of the battle as part of a wider project to produce a panoramic painting of the battle. His preliminary painting from 1879, titled The Defense of Champigny, is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Detaille successfully completed a massive 52 × 400 ft panorama (titled the Battle of Champigny) in 1882, but over the years said work was divided into multiple smaller paintings.[7] The fragment of the panorama that mirrors The Defense of Champigny was auctioned off to a private buyer in 2012.[8]
 The painting projects a scene in which French soldiers are fortifying a position in the village of Villiers-sur-Marne in preparation for the Prussian counterattack that historically took place. Men are seen using pickaxes to bore through a wall to allow the French artillery to fire on the Prussians. Other soldiers are occupied with building barricades out of furniture, and in the background more soldiers are seen emptying a house (presumably a maison de maître) of its furnishings for use as barricading materiel. The painting uses muted colors to accentuate the bleakness of the French situation; the ground is a trodden, muddy brown covered with debris, and the sky is dull sunset yellow in reference to the imminent fall of Paris and the Second Empire. In the top center of the painting, shells can be seen exploding against the sky and birds can be seen in flight. A forest of barren trees can also be seen in the background; some are bare due to the battle's being fought in early December, while one tree has been snapped in two by a shell.[7]
 As far as the French soldiers themselves are concerned, the men are depicted as being haggard but active; some soldiers are seen to be wounded, while many others carry their rifles slung over their shoulders in defiance of traditional military discipline. However, all are active; even the men seen idling in the painting's foreground are depicted as awaiting their officer's command. General Faron of the French Ist Corp and a cadre of officers can be seen in discussion with a gardener immediately to the left of the painting's center. A sense of unease emanates from the painting, as the men (and the viewer) wait for the inevitable Prussian attack.[9] Whether they are officers or enlisted men, the French soldiers are portrayed in such a way as to be visually realistic while at the same time being portrayed in romanticized situations.[6] This is in keeping with Detaille's inclusion in the school of academic art, which borrowed heavily from Romanticism. The painting is also an example of Detaille's penchant for military art.[10][6]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_of_Life_(Valadon),Joy of Life (Valadon),"Joy of Life  (La Joie de vivre)[1] is an oil painting by Suzanne Valadon, completed in 1911.[2] It was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, in 1967.[2]
 Suzanne Valadon's Joy of Life depicts a landscape with four nude and seminude women who are watched by a nude man.[3] The nude male was modeled by Valadon's lover, André Utter.[4] They met through her son, Maurice Utrillo, and Utter modeled nude for several of Valadon's paintings, including Adam and Eve (1909) and Casting the Net (1914).[4]
 Joy of Life is based on the theme of ""women as nature"", a typical subject at the time.[1] Gill Perry has argued that the painting reworks the theme of bathers in nature.[3] She notes that the women ""seem strangely separate from each other, the male viewer and from the nature that surrounds them"", which suggests a ""more ambiguous, dislocated relationship with both nature and the male spectator"".[3] There is a certain disconnection between the male viewer and the nude women as they seem startled to notice him. Perry's reading is echoed by Patricia Mathews, who has described the figures as being in nature, but not equivalent to nature.[1] She suggests that the male viewer ""has no other role in the painting except as this near-caricature of the dominating male gaze"", as the women are unaware of being watched.[5]
 Rosemary Betterton has argued that the figures disrupt the male gaze and are, in fact, being caught in a moment without being sexualized.[1] According to Mathews, the painting does not offer the ""coherent narrative that so clearly dominated masculinist images"".[5] Valadon's Joy of Life, Mathews has noted, is consistent with the ways in which ""various narratives intersect in her work in often uncomfortable ways to dislodge and destabilize conventional gendered interpretations"".[5]
 In Casting the Net, completed three years later, Valadon actually reversed the traditional active male/passive female concept by casting the nude male in the role of object.[6]

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hall_of_Antiquities_at_Charlottenborg_Palace,_Copenhagen","The Hall of Antiquities at Charlottenborg Palace, Copenhagen","The Hall of Antiquities at Charlottenborg Palace, Copenhagen is a 19th-century painting by Danish artist Adam August Müller. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a young custodian guarding the hall of antiquities at Charlottenborg Palace, Copenhagen. The work is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Produced in 1830, Hall of Antiquities was painted by Adam August Müller while the young artist was under the tutelage of Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. A prominent artist of the Danish Golden Age, Eckersberg encouraged his young student to produce paintings in his own style; with the support of his influential tutor, Müller was able to paint in the style of History painting—an uncommon genre among Danish painters of the time.[1]
 At the time of Müller's rendering of Hall of Antiquities, the most extensive collection of antiquities in Denmark was located in Charlottenborg Palace. The palace was also the seat of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Art, and as such was attached great cultural importance in Denmark.[1]
 Müller's work depicts three chambers in Charlottenborg Palace's hall of antiquities. Several Hellenic sculptures can be seen, as can the relief Hector's Body Surrounded by His Mourning Family, by the contemporaneous Herman Wilhelm Bissen.[1] A single young man (a custodian) can be seen, dressed in the red frock uniform of the palace.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_the_Figure_5_in_Gold,I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold,"I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold, also known as The Figure 5 in Gold,[1] is a 1928 painting by American artist Charles Demuth. It has been described as influenced by Futurism and Cubism.
 William Carlos Williams claims that the inspiration for the 32-word poem ""The Great Figure""[2] (1920) came from seeing a fire engine pass him by, sounding gong clangs and siren howls as it receded in the night. He said he was so struck by the sight that he took paper and pencil out of his pocket and wrote the poem, standing there on the sidewalk.[3] Two lines: ""I saw the figure 5/in gold"" were taken by Demuth for his painting's title.[4] The upper right corner has an arc, implying a fragment of a large number five, repeated three times in progressively smaller, complete number fives to create an impression of the fire engine moving away from the viewer. The fire engine itself is reduced to an abstracted form composed of red rectangles, but there is a hint of a ladder on the right side and an axle across the bottom. Above the truck are globular streetlamps flanked by sidewalks and buildings in blacks and grays. Demuth conveyed his friendship with Williams by incorporating fragments of his name: ""Bill"" across the top, and ""CARLO"" (the ""O"" cut off and the ""S"" missing entirely) in yellow dots as in an illuminated theater sign. Across the bottom the painter has placed his own initials ""C.D."" and also the poet's ""W.C.W."" in the same size and color.[3]
 Demuth was known as a painter in the  Precisionist style, incorporating clean lines and geometry into images. Art historian H.W. Janson mentions Demuth's interactions with Cubist painters in New York, and the connections between Futurism and Precisionism styles.[5] This particular work was part of a series of five abstract, poster-style portraits Demuth painted between 1924 and 1929 in homage to his personal artist and writer friends: William Carlos Williams, Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Charles Duncan and John Marin.[1] He and Williams had become friends when they were both living in the same boarding house in Philadelphia while Demuth was studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and Williams was attending the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. As with I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold, each painting incorporated the artist's name. This portrait series is often described as also including writers Marsden Hartley, Gertrude Stein, Eugene O'Neill and Wallace Stevens, but those four were never completed. The Yale University Art Gallery has the preliminary sketch, in watercolor and graphite, for the Marsden Hartley portrait.[6]
 The painting was first exhibited at Intimate Gallery, New York as ""Charles Demuth: Five Paintings,"" April 29 – May 18, 1929. It is in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, United States of America (MMA). It is described as a combination of oil paint, graphite, ink, and gold leaf on paperboard. Dimensions 35+1⁄2 by 30 inches (90 cm × 76 cm). Demuth died in 1935, at the age of 51 years. He bequeathed the painting to Georgia O'Keeffe. She donated it to the MMA in 1948 as part of the Alfred Stieglitz Collection.[4] The painting has never been sold.
 Roberta Smith described the work in The New York Times: ""Demuth's famous visionary accounting of Williams, I Saw the Figure Five in Gold, [is] a painting whose title and medallion-like arrangement of angled forms were both inspired by a verse the poet wrote after watching a fire engine streak past him on a rainy Manhattan street while waiting for Marsden Hartley, whose studio he was visiting, to answer his door.""[7] Describing its importance, Judith H. Dobrzynski in The Wall Street Journal wrote: ""It's the best work in a genre Demuth created, the 'poster portrait'. It's a witty homage to his close friend, the poet William Carlos Williams, and a transliteration into the paint of his poem 'The Great Figure'. It's a decidedly American work made at a time when U.S. artists were just moving beyond European influences. It's a reference to the intertwined relationships among the arts in the 1920s, a moment of cross-pollination that led to American Modernism. And it anticipates pop art.""[1]
 Robert Indiana, a popular and famous artist from the 1960s onward, painted The Figure Five in 1963. It incorporated the three yellow/gold, size-diminishing number fives from Charles Demuth's painting superimposed over a red star.[8]
 Demuth's painting is used as the cover picture of the novel Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture (1992). The painting is included in a book 100 Best Paintings in New York (2008).[9]
 In March 2013, the US Postal Service issued a pane of 12 first-class postage stamps portraying modern art, one of which was Demuth's painting. The timing was 100 years after the Armory Show, New York, 1913, which had given many Americans their first look at modern art. The stamp set was titled Modern Art in America 1913–1931 Stamps.[10]

Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a scene in which the mythological figure Orion — having been blinded — searches for the rising sun.
 The painting's scene was inspired by the Assyrian writer Lucian's writings on Greek mythology, including the Orion legend. Poussin painted Blind Orion on behalf of Michel Passart, a well-known patron of landscape painting. Poussin's work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which considers the work to be one of Poussin's greatest landscape paintings.[1]

The work depicts a small boy costumed as a page of the Spanish court of the seventeenth century; he is holding a full-sized sword and sword belt. The work was later reproduced as an etching under the direction of Dijon painter and etcher Alphonse Legros who collaborated in the work.[1]
 According to Émile Zola, the work is typical of the influence of Spanish painters[2] and shows the strong influence Diego Velázquez and Frans Hals had on Manet at the time.
 The artist's model was Leon Leenhoff, the stepson of the artist after his marriage to Suzanne in 1862. Some report that Leon might have been Manet's actual son with Suzanne. Some other report that the father could have been Manet's own father, Auguste.[3][4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_with_a_Staff,Christ with a Staff,"Christ with a Staff or St James the Less is a painting by a follower of Rembrandt, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was also known as Christ in 1854 and exhibited in 1933 as The Pilgrim.[1]
 The picture is in Rembrandt's style of the 1660s and may have been painted in his workshop.[1] Whilst the brushwork certainly imitates his unique style, some scholars have suggested that its manner of execution is similar to that of Arent de Gelder (1645–1727), one of his latter pupils.[1]
 In 1661 Rembrandt made a series of paintings of the apostles, including Self-Portrait as the Apostle Paul; these may have influenced this work. In an image by the copper-plate engraver Schelte a Bolswert, after a drawing by Gerard Seghers, St James the Less is shown with a book.
 The work is first mentioned in 1836, when it was in the collection of Christopher Bethell-Codrington. When his estate was auctioned on 12 May 1843 it was sold for £252 to the art dealer Christianus Johannes Nieuwenhuys. On 11 December 1854 it was sold at auction for 13,000 francs to count Raczyński from the collection of Baron de Mecklembourg in Paris. In 1898 it was owned by Edward Aleksander Raczyński in Poznań. A year after his death it was sold for $150,000 to Duveen Brothers, an art dealer, who resold it later that year to Jules Bache in New York for $300,000. Bache left it to its present owner.

Warrener – a close friend of Lautrec – and two women at the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris.[1] The painting served as a preparatory study for a color lithograph of 1892, and is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which acquired it in 1967.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_at_Sainte-Adresse,Garden at Sainte-Adresse,"The Garden at Sainte-Adresse is a painting by the French impressionist painter Claude Monet. (Oil on canvas, 98.1 by 129.9 centimetres (38.6 in × 51.1 in)).[1] The painting was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art after an auction sale at Christie's in December 1967, under the French title La terrasse à Sainte-Adresse.[2] The painting was exhibited at the 4th Impressionist exhibition, Paris, April 10–May 11, 1879, as no. 157 under the title Jardin à Sainte-Adresse.
 Monet spent the summer of 1867 at the resort town of Sainte-Adresse on the English Channel, near Le Havre (France).[1] It was there, in a garden with a view of Honfleur on the horizon, that he painted this picture,[1] which combines smooth, traditionally rendered areas with sparkling passages of rapid, separate brushwork, and spots of pure colour.
 The models were probably Monet's father, Adolphe, in the foreground, Monet's cousin's wife Jeanne-Marguerite Lecadre at the fence; Adolphe, her father; and perhaps, Sophie, her sister, the woman seated with her back to the viewer.[1] Although the scene projects affluent domesticity, it is by no means a family portrait. Monet's relations with his father were tense that summer, owing to family disapproval of the young artist's liaison with his companion, Camille Doncieux, his wife-to-be.
 Monet called this work in his correspondence ""the Chinese painting in which there are flags"". His friend Pierre-Auguste Renoir referred to it as ""the Japanese painting"". In the 1860s, the composition's flat horizontal bands of colour would have reminded the sophisticated of Japanese colour wood-block prints,[1] which were avidly collected by Monet, Manet, Renoir, Whistler, and others in their circle. The print by the Japanese artist Hokusai that may have inspired this picture, Turban-shell Hall of the Five-Hundred-Rakan Temple (1830),[3] remains today at Monet's house-museum at Giverny.[4]
 The elevated vantage point and relatively even sizes of the horizontal areas emphasize the two-dimensionality of the painting. The three horizontal zones of the composition seem to rise parallel to the picture plane instead of  receding into space. The subtle tension resulting from the combination of illusionism and the two-dimensionality of the surface remained an important characteristic of Monet's style.
 The painting is now in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was bought in 1967, with special contributions given or bequeathed by friends of the Museum.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse_and_goldfish,Henri Matisse and goldfish,"
 French visual artist Henri Matisse was known for his use of color and draughtsmanship. In the early 20th century, Matisse became a leader of the Fauvism art movement, which was an early movement in the broader Post-impressionist era.
 After a trip to Morocco in 1912 Matisse employed goldfish in aquariums as a motif in his art. While retaining the use of color which he is notable for, Matisse included goldfish in various still life scenarios, often as a feature found in depictions of his various studios rather than the focus of pieces. 
 The motif would be present in Matisse's art mostly during the early and mid-1910s, but also in the 1920s. Most of these pieces were oil on canvas still life paintings, but Matisse would produce etchings, drawings, and prints featuring the motif in 1929.
 Art historians have commented that Matisse's works featuring goldfish explore the themes of contemplation, tranquility, and pictorial space, with Matisse configuring complex arrangements for the latter. The aquariums the goldfish swim around in function as a metaphor for the studio. 
 In the first two decades of the 20th century, Matisse visited Islamic art exhibitions. He also traveled to Algeria and Morocco, collecting pottery, textiles, and tiles.[1] In 1909, Matisse moved from Paris to nearby Issy-les-Moulineaux to escape Parisian pressures.[2] He portrayed his Issy studio in The Red Studio (L'Atelier Rouge), a 1911 oil on canvas painting considered one of the most influential pieces of modern art by experts.[3][4] The studio would be often depicted in Matisse's goldfish paintings that would follow.
 In January 1912, Matisse visited Tangier in Morocco, where he stayed through April.[2] While there, Matisse noted how the locals were drawn to watching goldfish swim around in bowls. Matisse admired the ""relaxed and contemplative"" lifestyle Moroccans had, a view shared with other Europeans who visited North Africa, according to Smarthistory.[2] Previously in 1908, Matisse wrote that he dreamed of: 
 an art of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter, an art that could be [...] a soothing, calming influence on the mind, something like a good armchair that provides relaxation from fatigue.[5] Goldfish became a frequently recurring motif in Matisse's art from 1912 to 1915.[a] Sculptures, flowers, and windows were also common motifs found in Matisse's goldfish paintings.[4] The 1910s decade was ""an extremely reflective period of his career when new spatial configurations were explored,"" and found Matisse using Cubist devices ""for his illusionary ends, so as to paradoxically suggest enclosure.""[4]
 After returning to Issy from his trip to Morocco, Matisse produced a series of nine paintings during the spring and early summer of 1912, of which Goldfish was included. Unlike his other paintings featuring the titular animals, this painting featured the goldfish as its focus.[2] Goldfish and Sculpture was also painted in this spring–summer 1912 period.[7] This painting features his Reclining Nude from 1907, now taking on ""the peachy skin tone of an imagined Caucasian model.""[8] Matisse also produced the piece, Studio with Goldfish (L'Atelier aux poissons rouges), dated May–end of September 1912.[9]
 Matisse would later depict his experience visiting Morocco in Arab Coffeehouse (Le café Maure) (1912–13).[2] A companion piece, Zorah on the Terrace portrays a woman gazing at fish. In both Arab Coffeehouse and Zorah on the Terrace figure their subjects ""in an attitude of profound attention.""[4]
 In 1914, he produced Interior with a Goldfish Bowl,[b] which has a notable use of blue color.[10] Goldfish with Palette, dated November 1914–spring 2015, was also made during this period.[11] These two pieces were painted at Matisse's studio at 19, quai Saint-Michel.[12]
 Goldfish would again appear in Matisse's work in the following decade, such as in The Goldfish Bowl (winter 1921–22).[13] Now living in Nice by this point, Matisse employed a particular interest in sunlight streaming in from a window in this piece.[13] Young Woman before an Aquarium (Jeune fille devant un aquarium) was also painted during this time, between September 1921 and February 1922.[14] A similar Woman before an Aquarium painting (dated 1921–1923), included elements Matisse encountered in his trips to North Africa.[1] The interior scene includes a decorative patterned textile screen.[1]
 In 1929, Matisse once again included goldfish in his art. He produced a variety of drawings and prints featuring the motif.[4] In November, he produced a series of ten etchings featuring a female head looking at a goldfish bowl.[15] While working on the series, Matisse sketched directly onto small, hand-held copper plates.[15] For many of the sketches, Matisse employed a chine-collé printmaking technique.[16][17][18]
 The goldfish motif has been connected to theme of contemplation. Noted to be aware of this theme, Matisse once remarked to Marcel Sembat, ""those big devils, there for hours, contemplative, before a flower and some red fish.""[4] On Goldfish and Palette, this ""artistic meditation is stressed, as the Moroccans' gaze becomes likened to the artist's own reflections on artistic containment.""[4] Goldfish also came to symbolize a tranquil and serene state of mind that he perceived the Moroccans to have, which he admired,[2][5] as well as a ""paradise lost"".[2] Appealing for ""contemplative relaxation for the viewer"" was a major theme in Matisse's work found in Goldfish.[2]
 Pictorial space and its configuration is also a common theme found in the goldfish paintings.[2][4] Goldfish had a ""complex construction of pictorial space.""[2] The arrangement of Interior with a Goldfish Bowl ""underscores Matisse's interest in windows as passageways between interior and exterior spaces.""[12] Matisse's studio is often found in the goldfish paintings, and the goldfish swimming around in aquariums has been viewed as a metaphor for the studio.[2] Kate Linker of Artforum wrote that implicit features ""in these studios"" are extended to other spaces, elaborating that ""the spaces in Matisse's paintings are not generally organized by formal coherence or design, but in a symbolic manner, using repetitions of shape and hue, thematic analogies or pictorial effects to enforce, or embody, their meaning.""[4]
 Linker also wrote that: 
 The roundness of The Red Studio returns us to the goldfish bowl, to which the painting bears clear affinities. If the bowl functions as a metaphor for space and for the artwork in its role of spatial summation, then The Red Studio can be regarded as its analogue.""[4] In 2022, Broadsheet commented on Interior with a Goldfish Bowl, writing that the piece has ""a special resonance for the contemporary viewer,"" and calling it ""a really rewarding work to look at in the age of [COVID-19], when we've all spent a little bit too long our own private space.""[10]
 In 2010, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York held the ""Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913–1917"" exhibition. Interior with Goldfish[b] and Goldfish and Palette were paired together at the exhibition.[19] Goldfish and Sculpture is also found at the MoMA.[7] As of 2022, Matisse's goldfish paintings are located in art museums throughout the world.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Today,America Today,"America Today is a mural comprising ten canvas panels, painted with egg tempera in 1930–1931 by the American painter Thomas Hart Benton. It provides a panorama of American life throughout the 1920s, based on Benton's extensive travels in the country. Originally commissioned for The New School for Social Research, it has belonged to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, since 2012.
 The mural was commissioned in 1929 by Alvin Saunders Johnson, director of The New School for Social Research in New York City, for the school's boardroom. Benton was not offered any payment beyond material costs. Instead, he saw the work as an opportunity to make a name for himself and thereby get more commissions in the future. The subjects were based on Benton's extensive travels in the United States. Benton said about the work: ""Every detail of every picture is a thing I myself have seen and known. Every head is a real person drawn from life.""[2] The mural was painted with egg tempera on linen canvases.[1]
 The mural was acquired by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company in 1984. After two years of renovation it was installed at AXA's headquarters at 787 Seventh Avenue in New York City. In 1996 AXA moved to 1290 Avenue of the Americas and installed the mural in the building's lobby. In January 2012 the mural was renovated again, and in December 2012 it was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigand_and_His_Wife_in_Prayer,Brigand and His Wife in Prayer,"Brigand and His Wife in Prayer is an early 19th century painting by Léopold Robert. Done in oil paint on canvas, the work depicts a brigand and his wife in prayer before a cross in the mountains of central Italy. The painting is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and is part of the museum's Whitney Collection, mostly French works from the 18th and 19th centuries collected and given by Wheelock Whitney III.
 Brigand and His Wife in Prayer was painted by Swiss painter Louis Léopold Robert in 1824. The work concerns a brigand and his wife, part of the brigante subculture of central Italy. The people and culture of the Brigante became a common subject of Robert's painting after he witnessed the mass arrest of brigands and their families by the government of the Papal States.[1] The painting was originally intended to be entered to win the Prix de Rome, a prestigious art scholarship. However, due to Robert's nationality and the contentious nature of post-Napoleonic European politics, Robert instead painted the work for the Salon of 1824 in Paris. The painting was well received for its naturalistic depiction of people, though it was criticized for not subscribing to a particular genre of art.[1]
 The painting itself portrays a brigand and his pregnant wife kneeling in prayer before a roadside shrine. The place of worship takes the form of a simple wooden cross located on a remote road, with vast mountains towering in the background. The couple are both dressed as people of their class and vocation would be. The husband is dressed in a frilled shirt and overcoat, and rests his musket at his shoulder. The wife is dressed in traditional peasant's garb and clutches a rosary in her right hand. They pray for the health and success of each-other, specifically for the success of the husband's criminal activities and for the health of the heavily pregnant wife. The sympathy-inspiring depictions of the frugality and piety of the couple reflect Robert's fascination with the culture of the Italian brigands, who the painter found to be a faithful people despite their criminality.[1]

 The painting is also known as Boy with a glass and a lute and shows a young lute-player wearing a beret and a draped cloak over his chest, tilting his glass to show it is empty while facing the viewer in order to say ""time is up"". It was attributed to Hals for centuries until Claus Grimm called it a product of his circle. According to Hofrichter, the positioning of a figure sitting behind a table is a typical Leyster theme, and the upward glance is reminiscent of her Violin player, while the application of paint is similar to her Two children with a cat.[1]
 In the 17th century, the gesture of tipping the glass down to see if a drop of wine appears on a fingernail was a method to show one wanted a refill. The scene is often shown with figures in theatrical costumes.
 
In his 1910 catalog of Frans Hals works Hofstede de Groot noted this painting may be the same one as a painting sold in Rotterdam in 1825 and wrote: 86. THE FINGER-NAIL TEST (or, The Mandoline-Player with a Wine-Glass). M. 210. Half-length. A mandoline-player sits at a table, with his body turned three-quarters right, but facing the spectator. In his uplifted right hand, with the little finger erect, he holds a green goblet downwards; under it is his left hand, also with the little finger erect. The top of his orange-yellow mandoline rests on his left arm; the bottom of it lies on the table. He has long hair, and wears a cap on the back of his head, to the right. He has a bright red costume with a greyish-purple cloak, white frills at his wrists, and a white band at the throat. An olive- green curtain hangs behind him. [Compare 74.]
Canvas, 28 inches by 23 inches. Exhibited at Dublin, 1857. In the collection of J. Napper of Lough Crew Castle, Oldcastle, Meath. Sale. Dublin, autumn of 1906 (3990, Sulley). In the possession of the London dealers Dowdeswell. In the possession of the London dealer C. Wertheimer. In the possession of the Paris dealers Kleinberger and Wildenstein. In the collection of B. Altman, New York.[2] This painting could be related to Young Man with a Skull in which a boy is also wearing a beret and draped cloak, and is also similar to a painting with the same alternate name, Boy with a Glass and a Lute.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Girl_Asleep,A Girl Asleep,"A Girl Asleep (Dutch: Slapend meisje), also known as A Woman Asleep, A Woman Asleep at Table, and A Maid Asleep,[1] is a painting by the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, created c. 1657.[2] It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and may not be lent elsewhere under the terms of the donor's bequest.[1]
 Technical examination of the painting revealed a man in the second room and a dog looking at him.
[3]
According to Liedtke, the presence of the dog would have alluded to ""the sort of impromptu relationships canine suitors strike up on the street."" The man and the dog were replaced with a mirror on a far wall, suggesting how the experience of the senses quickly passes, and a chair left at an angle with a pillow on it, possibly signifying indolence, together with a hint of recent company. The idea that she was recently together with someone is reinforced by the wine pitcher, the glass on its side and the possible presence of a knife and fork on the table. The Chinese bowl with fruit is a symbol of temptation, and for a Vermeer contemporary familiar with the symbolism of Dutch art of the time, the knife and jug lying open-mouthed under a gauzy material would have brought to mind more than social intercourse.[1]
 The painting was very likely owned by Vermeer's patron, Pieter van Ruijvan, who also owned The Milkmaid, which has a similar tension between the symbolism of sexual or romantic relations with maids and their presentation in a way that was more sympathetic than the established tradition.[1]
 The painting was among the large collection of Vermeer works sold on May 16, 1696, from the estate of Jacob Dissius (1653–1695). It is widely believed the collection was originally owned by Dissius' father-in-law, Pieter Claesz van Ruijven of Delft as Vermeer's major patron, then passed down to Ruijven's daughter (1655–1682), who would have left it to Dissius. The work's history from that point is unknown until its ownership by John Waterloo Wilson in Paris after 1873. It was sold on March 14, 1881, in Paris when the Sedelmeyer Gallery in Paris bought it and sold it later that year to Rodolphe Kann, also of Paris. Kann owned the work until 1907. It was sold in 1908 through the Duveen Brothers of London to Benjamin Altman, and it was exhibited in New York in 1909. Altman owned the work until 1913, when it passed into the hands of the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a bequest.[1]

 Manet was inspired to paint it after a painting of a brioche by 18th-century artist Jean Siméon Chardin was donated to the Louvre in Paris. In Manet's work the brioche is accompanied by peaches and plums. It is singular among Manet's still lifes for its formality, and mark the last time he would paint such an elaborate tabletop composition.[2]

This page is addressed mainly to those editing Wikipedia. For information for readers, see Wikipedia:FAQ/Categories.
 For more detailed guidelines on creating and organizing categories, see Help:Category. More technical information can be found at Wikipedia:Categorization.
 Categories allow articles to be placed in one or more groups, and allow those groups to be further categorized. An article belonging to a category should contain a link to a page that describes the category. Similarly, a sub-category belonging to a parent category should contain a link to the parent category's page.
 Each category page contains an introduction that can be edited like an article, and an automatically generated list of links to sub-categories and articles that belong to the category.
 Categories do not form a strict hierarchy or tree of categories, since each article can appear in more than one category, and each category can appear in more than one parent category. This allows multiple categorization schemes to co-exist.
 See meta:Categorization requirements for the original purpose of the feature.
 The best way to find out what exists is to browse. Either start at Wikipedia:Browse or Category:Articles, which shows the ""top"" level categories, to which all other categories should be connected. A list of all categories can be found at Special:Categories – there are many listed but you can use the search box. Category:Wikipedia categories is the standard top-level category provided by the MediaWiki software, but orphan categories (categories without any parent categories) can exist.
 Grouping articles into a category is not the same as making a list of articles. To edit a list of articles, you edit the list directly; but to place articles into a category, you edit an article and insert a category tag by placing [[Category:<category name>]] in the body of the text. This adds those articles as a list on the category's page.
 While an article may be in multiple lists, the goal is that browsing downwards from a list parent category, e.g. Category:People, you should only arrive at articles that are about people, and not related articles.
 Further information on this topic can be found at Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates.
 Lists are still useful for showing ""missing"" articles.
 John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry has an article, a category, and a navigation template.
 A navigation template is a collection of links on a single topic, formatted in a standard way, in a box with a border. These links can be arranged in different ways within the box. The box is placed at the right or at the foot of the pages linked in it.
 There are fewer navigation templates than categories. There is no requirement that a page be linked in a navigation template, whereas every page must belong to at least one category, and almost always more.
 When appropriate, however, a navigation template organizes links in a far more useful way than categories do. It permits many nuances that categories can not, or can only clumsily. For the reader, a navigation template, if it exists, makes finding related articles much faster.
 Templates are more complicated to create than categories, and the Wikipedian wishing to create one may want to use an existing template as a model.
 Yes, it is expected that most pages will be members of one category or more. Similarly, each category can be a member of more than one parent category.
 Some categories exist to aid maintenance of the project, for example, template categories and redirect categories. Maintenance categories are often added by templates rather than links. Contributors monitor these maintenance categories for many reasons to cleanup articles. Maintenance categories are usually ""hidden"" from view and can be seen only by registered users who have set their preferences to see hidden categories, which is easy to do:
 Templates used to populate redirect categories are indexed functionally and alphanumerically at Wikipedia:Template messages/Redirect pages.
 Use the Wikipedia titling conventions of no unnecessary capital letters or abbreviations, i.e. use [[Category:Category examples]] instead of [[Category:Category E.g.]].
 If the category collects articles, then avoid the word List in the name of the category, and use plurals, e.g. Category:Popes.
 However, if the category collects lists, then using the word Lists in the name of the category is appropriate, e.g. Category:Lists of radio stations.
 Use the topic name without indicating structure, e.g. [[Category:History of London]] instead of [[Category:History - Europe - UK - London]].
 For more on this, see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories).
 Edit the article and add [[Category:Category name]] at the bottom of the article.
For example: [[Category:Mind-body interventions]].
 To link to the category page, put a colon before the word ""category"", inside the link, e.g. [[:Category:United States]], which will appear as Category:United States.
 Category tags should be placed at the bottom of the article, after the appendices (e.g. References and External links). This ensures that when an editor presses ""edit"", the editor is immediately presented with the main article text, rather than the more esoteric category tags. It also ensures that the category tags are in a consistent place so they are easy to find.
 Both the alphabet and importance are used to order categories currently. Although this, like most ordering issues in Wikipedia, is a matter for judgment, it is generally clear that some categories – for example the birthplace or birth year of a person – are less important than others, such as their status as an Oscar or Nobel Prize winner. 
 See also Wikipedia:Overcategorization.
 Use a {{DEFAULTSORT}} tag, which looks like {{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, John}}. All categories will then sort under ""Smith"" unless a sorting key is used for them (see below).
 For individual categories, use a sorting key. For example, an article categorized by [[Category:Proper category|Sorting key]] would appear under S within the category.
 Articles about people should be categorized cautiously. Unlike the body of the article, the various category choices for people can focus on, in most cases, what are common and unrelated attributes such as place of birth and gender, instead of emphasising the reason for their inclusion.
 See Wikipedia:Categorization of people for guidelines.
 All contributions to Wikipedia may be ""edited mercilessly"". If the change was not explained in the article history or talk page, try leaving a question on the relevant user's talk page. Remember to follow the bold, revert, discuss procedure.
 Try to categorize it yourself. If you are unable to, add the {{Uncategorized}} template to the article, which will place a notice that the article needs categorizing, and automatically add it to the list at Category:Uncategorized pages.
 If there is one, you can join the WikiProject involved.
 If you want to restructure some existing categories, it is best to discuss your plans with others working in the same areas, or at least to announce your intentions.
 A category page should contain a brief description of the purpose of the category. A prominent link to the most important article in the category is usually a good idea, but please avoid copying large quantities of text or images from an article to a category page. 
 In many cases, a category has a ""main article"", which describes the subject of that category. The category and the article often have the same name. In such case, do this:
 If the subject has count, then make the category name plural and create a redirect of that same, plural name, redirecting back to the singular name. For instance City and Category:Cities. That is, create a page called ""Cities"" and add the line
 In theory, if a main article is categorized correctly in its corresponding category, the use of the cat main template is redundant.

Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts the aftermath of a storm or flood. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which holds the painting in its collection, compares Deluge's dark an dour themes as being in the Western tradition of portraying the Biblical flood. The painting was praised by painter Benjamin West, who had also produced works concerning the Biblical flood.[1]

 The painting was the result of sketches Sargent made in the Aosta Valley, in the foothills of the Italian Alps. He uses textured brushstrokes to convey the dappled sunlight falling on the forest, the hermit, and two deer. Despite the similarity with depictions of Saint Jerome in the wilderness, Sargent wrote to the director of the Metropolitan, ""I wish there were another simple word [other than Hermit] that did not bring with it any Christian association, and that rather suggested quietness and pantheism.""[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Card_Players,The Card Players,"
 The Card Players is a series of oil paintings by the French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Cézanne. Painted during Cézanne's final period in the early 1890s, there are five paintings in the series. The versions vary in size, the number of players, and the setting in which the game takes place. Cézanne also completed numerous drawings and studies in preparation for The Card Players series.
 One version of The Card Players was sold in 2000s to the Royal Family of Qatar for a price estimated at $250 million ($325.2 million today), signifying a new mark for highest ever price for a painting, not surpassed until November 2017.[1]
 The series is considered by critics to be a cornerstone of Cézanne's art during the early-to-mid 1890s period, as well as a ""prelude"" to his final years, when he painted some of his most acclaimed work.[2]
 Each painting depicts Provençal peasants immersed in
their pipes and playing cards. The subjects, all male, are displayed as studious within their card playing, eyes cast downward, intent on the game at hand. Cézanne adapted a motif from 17th-century Dutch and French genre painting which often depicted card games with rowdy, drunken gamblers in taverns, replacing them instead with stone-faced tradesmen in a more simplified setting.[2][3] Whereas previous paintings of the genre had illustrated heightened moments of drama,[4] Cézanne's portraits have been noted for their lack of drama, narrative, and conventional characterization.[5] Other than an unused wine bottle in the two-player versions, there is an absence of drink and money, which were prominent fixtures of the 17th-century genre. A painting by one of the Le Nain brothers, hung in an Aix-en-Provence museum near the artist's home, depicts card players and is widely cited as an inspiration for the works by Cézanne.[6][7]
 The models for the paintings were local farmhands, some of whom worked on the Cézanne family estate, the Jas de Bouffan.[6] Each scene is depicted as one of quiet, still concentration; the men look down at their cards rather than at each other, with the cards being perhaps their sole means of communication outside of work.[8] One critic described the scenes as ""human still life"",[2] while another speculated that the men's intense focus on their game mirrors that of the painter's absorption in his art.[9]
 While there are, in total, five paintings of card players by Cézanne, the final three works were similar in composition and number of players (two), causing them to sometimes be grouped together as one version.[10] The exact dates of the paintings are uncertain, but it is long believed Cézanne began with larger canvases and pared down in size with successive versions, though research in recent years has cast doubt on this assumption.[11][12]
 The largest version, painted between the years 1890–1892, is the most complex, with five figures on a 134.6 x 180.3 cm (53 × 71 in) canvas. It features three card players at the forefront, seated in a semi-circle at a table, with two spectators behind. On the right side of the painting, seated behind the second man and to the right of the third, is a boy, eyes cast downward, also a fixed spectator of the game. Further back, on the left side between the first and second player is a man standing, back to the wall, smoking a pipe and presumably awaiting his turn at the table. It has been speculated Cézanne added the standing man to provide depth to the painting, as well as to draw the eye to the upper portion of the canvas.[2]
As with the other versions, it displays a suppressed storytelling of peasant men in loose-fitting garments with natural poses focused entirely on their game.[4] Writer Nicholas Wadley described a ""tension in opposites"", in which elements such as shifts of color, light and shadow, shape of hat, and crease of cloth create a story of confrontation through opposition.[5] Others have described an ""alienation"" displayed in the series to be most pronounced in this version.[3]
The painting is owned and displayed by the Barnes Foundation museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
 A more condensed version of this painting with four figures, long thought to be the second version of The Card Players, is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. At 65.4 x 81.9 cm (25 3/4 x 32 1/4 in), it is less than half the size of the Barnes painting. Here the composition remains virtually the same, minus the boy, with viewers' perspective slightly closer to the game, but with less space between the figures. In the previous painting, the center player as well as the boy were hatless, whereas this version has all the men hatted. Also gone are the shelf to the left with vase and lower half of a picture frame in the center of the wall, leaving only the four pipes and hanging cloth to join the smoking man behind the card players. The painting is brighter, with less focus on blue tones, than the larger version. 
X-ray and infrared studies of this version of The Card Players have shown layers of ""speculative"" graphite underdrawing, as well as heavy layers of worked oil paint, possibly suggesting it was the preliminary of Cézanne's two largest versions of the series, rather than the second version as historically believed.[12] The underdrawing has also led analysts to believe Cézanne had difficulty transferring the men, previously painted individually in studies, onto one canvas.[2][12]
 It has been speculated that Cézanne solved this ""spatial conundrum"" in the final three versions of The Card Players, by eliminating spectators and other ""unnecessary detail"" while displaying only the ""absolute essentials"": two players immersed in their game.[2][13] The scene has been described as balanced but asymmetrical,[3] as well as naturally symmetrical with the two players being each other's ""partner in an agreed opposition"".[10] The man on the left is smoking a pipe, wearing a tophat with a downcast brim, in darker, more formal clothing, seated upright; the man to the right is pipeless, in a shorter hat with upcast brim, lighter, more loosely fit clothing, and hunched over the table.[10] Even cards themselves are contrasting light and dark hues. In each of the two-player paintings, a sole wine bottle rests in the mid-part of the table, said to represent a dividing line between the two participants[3] as well as the center of the painting's ""symmetrical balance"".[7]
Of the three versions, perhaps the best known and most often reproduced is in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. It is also the smallest at 47.5 x 57 cm (17 3/4 x 22 1/2 in). The Orsay painting was described by art historian Meyer Schapiro as ""the most monumental and also the most refined"" of the versions, with the shapes being simpler but more varied in their relationships.[10] It is the most sparsely painted, and generally considered the last of the Card Players series.[11]
 There is a shift of axis to the scene, in which the player to the left is more completely in the picture, chair included, with the appearance of being nearer to us.[10] His partner to the right is cut off from the scene at his back, and the table is displayed at an angle to the plane.[2] Critics have described a ""deception of restraint"" in Cézanne's use of color; graduated area of thinly applied, ""priming"" color used for solid forms and their appearance of structure is met with lilac and green used to ""liven"" the canvas, as well as the bright, deep color used on the lower half for the tablecloth.[7][13] This version of the series was also part of a high-profile theft of eight Cézanne paintings from a traveling show at Aix in August 1961. The most valuable of the stolen works, The Card Players, was released as a four-color postage stamp by the French government in recognition of the loss. All of the paintings were recovered after a ransom was paid several months later.[11]
 The other two-player paintings are in the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and in a private collection. In February 2012, Vanity Fai"
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_at_Medfield,_Massachusetts","Evening at Medfield, Massachusetts","Evening at Medfield, Massachusetts is a mid 19th-century painting by American artist George Inness. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts evening falling in the countryside near Medfield, Massachusetts. The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Inness painting Evening in 1875 after returning from a years-long trip to Italy and France.[1] His European travels inspired him to paint more naturalistic works in the style of the Barbizon school - a contrast to Inness' earlier works painted in the more romantic style of the Hudson river school. This shift can be seen in the more manipulated, organized style of Evening in which Inness arranged painting elements in horizontal bands. Inness' work also makes effective use of silhouettes cast by the setting sun.[2][3]
 The painting was done on pure white canvas, with Inness intentionally allowing for the texture of the material to be visible underneath the paint.[2] The artist also painted the sky and foreground using different amounts of paint, with the former being lightly applied and the latter more solidly applied.[2]
 Evening was donated to the Met by George A. Hearn in 1910.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garter,The Garter,"The Garter is an oil on canvas painting by French painter Jean-François de Troy, from 1724. It is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York. A pendant painting to this one is The Declaration of Love, of the same year.[1]
 The painting, like others by de Troy, is erotically charged, and depicts a scene of intimacy in a finely decorated room, between a couple, possibly of lovers that, judging by their fine clothing, are from the nobility. The woman, at the left, is reattaching the garter on her leg. The man, at her right, offers to help, but she rejects firmly his assistance with a gesture of her hand. The man's tricorn lies at the ground. At her left, a book lies on a table, where also stands a nude classical female statuette. Behind the table a mirror reflects the statuette and shows a nearby window. At the left a fine clock, decorated with a seated statuette of Saturn at his bottom, in a style similar to the work of the furniture designer André-Charles Boulle, stands in a bookshelf.[1][2]
 Mary Salzman states about this painting: ""In The Garter, the nude female statuette and the clock disclose that the young woman, though initially resistant, will allows herself to be seduced. She will eventually arrive at the same state of undress as the bronze - starting with her garter.""[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Bearing_the_Cross,Christ Bearing the Cross,"Christ Bearing the Cross is a painting in tempera attributed to the Greek painter Nikolaos Tzafouris. Tzafouris is considered one of the founding members of the Cretan School along with Andreas Ritzos, Andreas Pavias, and Angelos Akotantos. He was influenced by Angelos Akotantos. According to the Institute of Neohellenic Research, thirteen paintings are attributed to Tzafouris. Active between 1480 and 1501, Tzafouris had a workshop in Heraklion, where he painted religious themes for local churches. His most notable works are the Madre della Consolazione and Christ Bearing the Cross. 
 The painting is a mixture of Italian and Greek Byzantine prototypes; it follows the traditional maniera greca and was influenced by Venetian painting. Christ Bearing the Cross is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.[1][2][3]
 The work is painted in egg tempera with gold leaf on wood with dimensions of 69.2 cm (27.25 in) x 54.6 cm (21.5 in). The icon was finished towards the end of the 15th century. Christ is shown carrying a cross. The scene is the traditional Golgotha portion of the Crucifixion sequence. The soldiers on the right are dressed in armor modeled after Venetian attire, while the soldiers on the left of the painting wear Byzantine- or Cretan-styled armor.
 The soldiers' attire is painted in exquisite detail.  The Italian Renaissance painting style closely resembles the sfumato technique. The artist is trying to escape the typical flattened surface prevalent within the Byzantine-influenced maniera greca. Tzafouris attempts to create the illusion of a foreground and a background. The gilded background further accentuates the figures and landscape. The geometric shape of the mountain is reminiscent of Michael Damaskinos's Adoration of the Kings. The painting features Latin and Greek inscriptions. There are five icons signed by the author that survived; Christ Bearing the Cross is one of them.[4]

Its poor conservation, including over-harsh restoration to Mary's face, means that some art historians cannot accept it as an autograph work and theorise that it was produced by a follower of Mantegna after an autograph original. Its provenance is unknown before 1891, when it appeared for sale at a London art dealer. It was purchased by Charles Butler, from whom it passed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1926, where it still hangs.[1]
 If it is an autograph work, it dates from after Mantegna's trip to Rome and some attribute it to the end of his Paduan period (c.1460), suggested by comparison with the Presentation at the Temple, which has similar fictive marble frame in the foreground. It belongs to a group of small-format Madonnas produced by Mantegna for private devotion - others include Madonna with Sleeping Child (Berlin), the Poldi Pezzoli Madonna and the Bergamo Madonna. The cherubim are in blue and the seraphim in red, whilst the painter has drawn on Donatello's example in showing Mary incline her face towards her son.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Cavalryman,A Cavalryman,"A Cavalryman is an oil on canvas painting by French artist Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville, from 1884. It depicts a French cavalryman on a yellow field. The work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.
 A Cavalryman depicts a French dragoon of either the First or Second French Empires.[1] Dragoons were mounted infantry capable of riding into on an engagement on horses before dismounting to engage enemy forces on foot; this important role, coupled with the cost of horses, resulted in dragoons being known as elite-but-expensive troops.[2] Some sources identify the painting subject as a trumpeter.[1]
 Dragoons became a subject of various works of military art, including the works of the painter Ernest Meissonier, whose style De Neuville directly emulated in  the current painting.[3] The canvas itself was produced after the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War resulted in an upsurge of interest in the military in the French Third Republic. As noted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, De Neuville ""capitalized on the intense patriotism and dreams of military glory that the French defeat aroused"" with his work.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_the_Dead_(painting),Isle of the Dead (painting),"Isle of the Dead (German: Die Toteninsel) is the best-known painting of Swiss Symbolist artist Arnold Böcklin (1827–1901). Prints were very popular in central Europe in the early 20th century—Vladimir Nabokov observed in his 1936 novel Despair that they could be ""found in every Berlin home"".[1]
 Böcklin produced several different versions of the painting between 1880 and 1886, which today are exhibited in Basel, New York City, Berlin, and Leipzig. A sixth version, begun in autumn 1900 with the help of Böcklin's son Carlo Böcklin and finished by Carlo in 1901, is part of the Hermitage Museum's collection in Saint Petersburg.
 All versions of Isle of the Dead depict a desolate and rocky islet seen across an expanse of dark water. A small rowing boat is just arriving at a water gate and seawall on shore.[2] An oarsman maneuvers the boat from the stern. In the bow, facing the gate, is a standing figure clad entirely in white. Just ahead of the figure is a white, festooned object commonly interpreted as a coffin. The tiny islet is dominated by a dense grove of tall, dark cypress trees—associated by long-standing tradition with cemeteries and mourning—which is closely hemmed in by precipitous cliffs. Furthering the funerary theme are what appear to be sepulchral portals and windows on the rock faces.
 Böcklin himself provided no public explanation as to the meaning of the painting, though he did describe it as ""a dream picture: it must produce such a stillness that one would be awed by a knock on the door"".[3][4] The title, which was conferred upon it by the art dealer Fritz Gurlitt in 1883, was not specified by Böcklin, though it does derive from a phrase in an 1880 letter he sent to the painting's original commissioner.[5] Not knowing the history of the early versions of the painting (see below), many observers have interpreted the oarsman as representing the boatman Charon, who ferried souls to the underworld in Greek mythology. The water would then be either the River Styx or the River Acheron, and his white-clad passenger a recently deceased soul transiting to the afterlife.
 Isle of the Dead evokes, in part, the English Cemetery in Florence, Italy, where the first three versions were painted. The cemetery was close to Böcklin's studio and was also where his infant daughter Maria was buried. (In all, Böcklin lost 8 of his 14 children.)
 The model for the rocky islet was perhaps Pontikonisi, a small, lush island near Corfu, which is adorned with a small chapel amid a cypress grove,[6] perhaps in combination with the mysterious rocky island of Strombolicchio near the famous volcano Stromboli, Sicily. (Another less likely candidate is the island of Ponza in the Tyrrhenian Sea.)
 Böcklin completed the first version of the painting in May 1880 for his patron Alexander Günther, but kept it himself. In April 1880, while the painting was in progress, Böcklin's Florence studio had been visited by Marie Berna, née Christ (widow of financier Dr. Georg von Berna (1836–1865) and soon-to-be wife of the German politician Waldemar, Count of Oriola (1854–1910)). She was struck by the first version of this ""dream image"" (now in the Kunstmuseum Basel), which sat half completed on the easel, so Böcklin painted a smaller version on wood for her (now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York City). At Berna's request, he added the coffin and female figure, in allusion to her husband's death from diphtheria years earlier. Subsequently, he added these elements to the earlier painting. He called these works Die Gräberinsel (""Tomb Island"").[7] (Sometimes the ""Basel"" version is credited as the first one, sometimes the ""New York"".) It was acquired by the Gottfried Keller-Stiftung in 1920.[8]
 The third version was painted in 1883 for Böcklin's dealer Fritz Gurlitt. Beginning with this version, one of the burial chambers in the rocks on the right bears Böcklin's own initials: ""A.B."" In 1933, this version was put up for sale, and noted Böcklin admirer Adolf Hitler acquired it. He hung it first at the Berghof in Obersalzberg and then, after 1940, in the New Reich Chancellery in Berlin. It is now at the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin.
 Financial imperatives resulted in a fourth version in 1884, which was ultimately acquired by the entrepreneur and art collector Baron Heinrich Thyssen and hung at his Berliner Bank subsidiary. It was burned after a bomb attack during World War II and survives only as a black-and-white photograph.
 A fifth version was commissioned in 1886 by the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig, where it still hangs.
 In 1888, Böcklin created a painting called Die Lebensinsel (""Isle of Life""). Probably intended as an antipole to the Isle of the Dead, it also shows a small island, but with all signs of joy and life. Together with the first version of the Isle of the Dead, this painting is part of the collection of the Kunstmuseum Basel.
 A sixth version, allegedly created in 1901 and acquired in 2022 from a private collection, can be found at the State Hermitage (General Staff building) in Saint Petersburg. It bears the signatures A. Böcklin invenit (""devised by A. Böcklin"") and Carlo Böcklin fecit 1901  (""executed by Carlo Böcklin 1901""),[9] and can therefore be assumed to be the version mentioned by the Thieme-Becker biographical dictionary which was started by Arnold Böcklin together with Carlo in autumn 1900.[9]
 The painting has attracted a wide variety of admirers. Freud kept a reproduction in his office; Lenin had one above his bed; Hitler bought one of the originals. Vladimir Nabokov wrote that reproductions of the painting could be “found in every Berlin home”.[10]

It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.[1]
 The dating is uncertain - most art critics place it between the mid 1440s and the early 1450s, though some hypothesize it may have been a family gift to Ginevra degli Alessandri on her marriage to Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici on 20 January 1453. The work is originally thought to have consisted of a single panel, later divided up and finally restored into its present form as a triptych by Federico Zeri in 1971 by repainting vast areas at the base of the panel and Lawrence's legs.[2] Another kneeling figure is almost completely lost and other parts of the painted surface are damaged or lost.[3]
 It is thought to be the painting mentioned in Vasari's Lives of the Artists as being produced for the Alessandri family villa at Vincigliata near Florence. Around 1790 it was moved to the family's palazzo in Borgo Albizi in Florence. In 1912 it was sold to a London art dealer, who sold it on to another in New York, from which it passed to its present owner in 1935.

She was the first wife of the fruit importer (""Banana King"") Roger Ackerley, father of the writer J. R. Ackerley; she died after two years of marriage.[3][4] The monochromatic tones and emphasis on the figure's silhouette are reminiscent of the style of the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez, whose work Sargent had been encouraged to study by his Parisian teacher Carolus-Duran. It was exhibited to great acclaim at the Paris Salon of 1882.

Other versions are held by the Kunsthaus Zürich and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.[2]
 Monet created this work during his visit to Venice in late 1908. He returned to his home in France with many paintings incomplete, and he took a few years to prepare 29 works for exhibition. In 1912 he held a successful show Claude Monet Venise at the gallery Bernheim-Jeune in Paris.[1]
 Six versions (W1751 to W1756) were created to capture the varied lighting throughout the day. Monet often made multiple copies of the same work of art, a process known as series painting. His series paintings originated in his early career when he and other impressionists became interested in en plein air and were inspired by the effects of changing light.
 The Doge's Palace was done later in his career after he had already established his artistic style, however this work is considered less successful because of the scant time he spent in Venice and because he had to finish the series by memory later in Paris.[3]
 The Doge's Palace is composed of oil on canvas and its dimensions are 25 3/4 x 36 1/2 inches.  
 This work depicts the Doge's Palace, an iconic landmark of Venice and the historic seat of government of the Republic of Venice, along with buildings of the Riva degli Schiavoni waterfront. The scene is viewed from the island of San Giorgio Maggiore across the Bacino di San Marco canal. Monet chose a viewpoint on the edge of the piazza in front of Palladio's famous abbey church (Abbazia di San Giorgio Maggiore).
 Although Monet spent little time in Venice, works that he started in Venice, such as The Doge's Palace, are some of his most highly regarded. These paintings capture his signature style and influence from the effervescent Venetian sunset. After this painting was exhibited in Paris in 1912 it went on to travel the world, and has found its permanent home at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, N.Y.

 On June 19, 1864, the Kearsarge sank the Confederate raider  CSS Alabama at the Battle of Cherbourg in one of the most celebrated naval actions of the American Civil War. Many spectators were able to see the battle from the coast of France. Manet was inspired to make a painting of the battle, but not having witnessed it himself, relied on press descriptions to make an imaginary scene of the battle.[1] and within 26 days of the event, he had already completed this painting and placed on display in the print shop of Alfred Cadart in Paris.[2] This is the work known as The Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama, now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Several weeks later, Kearsarge made a port call at Boulogne-sur-Mer, where it drew wide media attention and numerous curious spectators, one of whom was Manet.
 Manet painted a watercolor of the ship anchored at Boulogne-sur-Mer, which is now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon, and later completed this oil-on-canvas painting.[3] The painting is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Done in oil on board, the work depicts Mount Etna and the surrounding Sicilian countryside near Catania. The drawing is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
 A member of the British middle class, Edward Lear (1812—1888) traveled extensively in Continental Europe.[1] In 1842 Lear began a series of excursions in Italy (then a divided series of states), during which he visited a number of regions and cities. Lear's trips to the Italian peninsula took place over a number of years, and in the summer of 1847 (after spending the winter in Rome) he visited the island of Sicily.[2] Lear was impressed by Sicily's history, scenery, and the artist went on to paint dozens of works depicting the island.[1][2]
 In June 1847, Lear and his friend John Proby visited the countryside near Mount Etna, a volcano near the Sicilian city of Catania. On 16 June, Lear sketched a notable drawing of Mount Etna and Catania, now known as Catania and Mount Etna. The following evening, Lear and Proby traveled to the mountain and ascended the volcanic cone.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation_(Memling),Annunciation (Memling),"
 The Annunciation is an oil painting by the Early Netherlandish Painter Hans Memling. It depicts the Annunciation, the archangel Gabriel's announcement to the Virgin Mary that she would conceive and become the mother of Jesus, described in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 1:26). The painting was executed in the 1480s and was transferred to canvas from its original oak panel sometime after 1928; it is today held in the Robert Lehman collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
 The panel shows Mary in a domestic interior with two attendant angels. Gabriel is dressed in ecclesiastical robes, while a dove hovers above Mary, representing the Holy Spirit. It expands upon the Annunciation wing of Rogier van der Weyden's Saint Columba Altarpiece of c. 1455. According to the art historian Maryan Ainsworth, the work is a ""startlingly original image, rich in connotations for the viewer or worshiper"".[1]
 The iconography focuses on the Virgin's purity. Her swoon foreshadows the Crucifixion of Jesus, and the panel emphasizes her role as mother, bride, and Queen of Heaven. The original frame survived until the 19th century and was inscribed with a date believed to be 1482; modern art historians have suggested that the number's final digit was a 9, which would give a date of 1489. In 1847, the art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen described the panel as one of Memling's ""finest and most original works"".[2] In 1902, it was exhibited in Bruges at the Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges, after which it underwent cleaning and restoration. The banker Philip Lehman bought it in 1920 from the Radziwiłł family, in whose collection it might have been since the 16th century; Antoni Radziwiłł discovered it on a family estate in the early 19th century. At that time, it had been pierced through with an arrow and required restoration.
 The Annunciation was a popular theme in European art,[3] although a difficult scene to paint, because it depicts Mary's union with Christ as she becomes the tabernacle for the Word made flesh. The doctrine of Mary as Theotokos, the God-bearer, was affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation – that Christ was of two natures (God and Man) – and Mary's perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia.[4] In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.[5]
 In Early Netherlandish art the Annunciation is typically set in contemporary domestic interiors, a motif and tradition established by Robert Campin, and followed by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden.[1] Neither Campin nor van Eyck went so far as to set the scene in a bedchamber,[4] although the motif is found in van der Weyden's Louvre Annunciation of c. 1435 and his Saint Columba Altarpiece of c. 1455, in which the Virgin kneels by the nuptial bed, rendered in red made from costly pigments.[6] Memling's depiction of the scene is nearly identical to that in the Saint Columba Altarpiece.[7]
 The archangel Gabriel appears before Mary to announce that she will bear the Son of God.[8] He is shown standing in a three-quarter view,[9] wearing a small jeweled diadem and dressed in vestments. He has a richly embroidered red-and-gold brocade cope, edged with a pattern of gray seraphim and wheels, over a white alb and amice. He holds his staff of office in one hand, and raises the other towards the Virgin.[10] He bends his knees, honoring and acknowledging her as Mother of Christ and Queen of Heaven,[1] and his feet are bare and positioned slightly behind hers.[11]
 The Virgin is in a frontal view;[9] directly behind her the red-curtained bed acts as a framing device, similar to the traditional canopy of honor or baldachin.[6] Unlike in the work of Memling's predecessors, whose Virgins are garbed in heavily jeweled and costly robes, the plain white shift she wears beneath a blue mantle is minimally jeweled at the hem and at the open neckline. A purple underdress peeks out at her neck and wrists, indicating her royal status.[5] Mary seems neither surprised nor fearful at the announcement; according to the art historian Shirley Neilsen Blum the scene is rendered with a great sense of naturalism and successfully depicts ""the transformation of Mary from girl to God-bearer"".[11]
 The Virgin holds an innovative and unusual position. She seems to be either rising or swooning as if having lost her balance, a divergence from her conventional seated or kneeling pose. Blum believes ""one may search in vain in other Netherlandish Annunciation panels of the fifteenth century of a Virgin positioned as she is here"".[6] The art historian Penny Jolly suggests that the painting shows a birthing position, a motif with which van der Weyden experimented in his Seven Sacraments Altarpiece, where the Virgin's collapse results in a childbirth-like posture, and in his Descent from the Cross, which has Mary Magdalene bending and crouching – similar to the position Memling's Magdalene assumes in his Lamentation.[12] Flanking the Virgin, and holding her, are two attendant angels. The one to the left lifts the Virgin's robe while the other gazes at the viewer, ""soliciting our response"", according to Ainsworth.[1] Both are small-statured, solemn, and, according to Blum, in mood ""comparable to that of Gabriel"".[13] Other than the presence of the angels, Memling shows a typical upper-merchant-class 15th-century Flemish bedchamber.[4]
 A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers inside a rainbow-hued circle of light directly above the Virgin's head. Its placement and size are unusual for art of the period. It is unlike anything found in van der Weyden, and is never repeated in Memling's work, but reminiscent of van Eyck's dove in the Ghent Altarpiece's Annunciation panel.[10] Its shape is found in medallions hung above beds at that time, and thus seems in keeping with the domestic interior.[4] Mary's left hand rests on an open prayer book, which she has propped open on a prie-dieu, with the letter ""D"" visible – perhaps for Deus tecum (""the Lord be with you""), according to Ainsworth.[1] Blum speculates that the passage is from Isaiah 7:14, ""Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a son"".[11] A vase containing white lilies and a single blue iris is next to it on the floor.[14]
 A curtain sack, commonly found on beds of the period, hangs in the central axis between Gabriel and the attendant angel.[15] A sideboard beside the bed contains two types of candles and a flask of water standing in bright light falling from the window to the left.[1] The floor is multi-colored tile-work, similar to that in van der Weyden's Saint Columba Altarpiece; Memling truncates the ceiling rafters in the mid-ground, at the end of the bed, with the floor extending into the foreground. Blum describes the effect as acting ""like an open stage for the holy figures"".[9]
 The iconography is not overly labored, and Memling avoids extraneous symbolism.[11] Many elements emphasize Mary's role as the Mother of God; the chamber is furnished with simple everyday objects that indicate her purity. The vase of lilies and the items on the sideboard are objects 15th-century viewers would have associated with her.[8] White lilies were often used to signify her purity, while irises or sword lilies were used as metaphors for her suffering.[14] Memling emphasizes symbols associated with her womb and virginity, ""introduces two additional angelic priests, and floods the room with natural light, thereby rearranging the anecdotal to emphasize the doctrinal meaning"".[11] Charles Sterling describes the work as ""one of the finest examples of Memling's ability to take a pictorial convention inherited from his predecessors and infuse it with a heightened sense of emotion and narrative complexity"".[16]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc_(painting),Joan of Arc (painting),"Joan of Arc (French: Jeanne d'Arc) is an oil on canvas painting by Jules Bastien-Lepage, from 1879. It was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889. It his held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.
 Joan of Arc, a national hero of France following the Hundred Years' War, became an increasingly important figure in the French cultural scene during the 1870s and 1880s, following the country's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. That conflict had seen Prussia annex the eastern part of Lorraine, the region both Joan of Arc and Bastien-Lepage were born in.[1]
 Bastien-Lepage completed the painting in 1879, and after being exhibited at the Salon in 1880, it was purchased by American businessman Erwin Davis.[2]
 The painting depicts the moment the saints Catherine of Alexandria, Margaret the Virgin, and the archangel Michael appeared to Joan of Arc in her parents' garden in Domrémy, urging her to fight the English.[1] Bastien-Lepage visited Domrémy in preparation for creating the painting; the village was near to his own birthplace, Damvillers.[3] His cousin, Marie-Adèle Robert, has been identified as the model for Joan; she previously modelled for other Bastien-Lepage paintings.[2]
 Critics at the Salon of 1880 where the painting was first exhibited praise Bastien-Lepage's use of Joan's pose and facial expression to demonstrate her spiritual awakening, though found the inclusion of the saints as being contrary to his usual naturalistic style; Joris-Karl Huysmans described it as ""false naturalism"".[1] The response to the painting reportedly led to Bastien-Lepage fleeing Paris for London, abandoning a similarly-styled painting of Ophelia.[1]
 Marie Bashkirtseff, an artist and contemporary of Bastien-Lepage, wrote in her diary about her outrage at the reception Joan of Arc received from French critics, accusing them of not properly appreciating it; she noted that the painting was properly ""worshipped"" in the USA.[4]

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery,_New_Mexico_(Marsden_Hartley)","Cemetery, New Mexico (Marsden Hartley)","Cemetery, New Mexico is an early 20th century painting by American artist Marsden Hartley. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a cemetery in Taos Pueblo, New Mexico. The work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 In 1918–1919, Marsden Hartley and a group of artists visited the American Southwest.[1] One destination on this trip was the state of New Mexico, specifically the town of Taos, the nearby Taos Pueblo Reservation (which housed a resident group of artists known as the Taos art colony) and Santa Fe. Hartley and his fellow travelers lived in the art colony for 18 months.[1] During this period of habitation, Hartley made a mental note of the area's topography, sky, and a small cemetery nearby. However, he was unable to render the scene into a painting at the time.[2]
 While visiting Europe (in a trip from 1923 to 1924), Hartley began painting a series of works he called ""recollections"".[2] The works Hartley produced in this series were painted from memory, with one such work being Cemetery, New Mexico, a Modernist painting depicting a small cemetery in Taos Pueblo. As noted in the Met's profile of Cemetery, Hartley painted from memory to emulate American artist Albert Pinkham Ryder, who the former admired.[2]
 Cemetery itself depicts a cemetery set before a mountain in Taos Pueblo, New Mexico.[2] As noted in the Met's profile of Cemetery, the work exhibits signs of being painted in an exaggerated, abstract, lazy-like way, likely a result of being painted from Hartley's memory.[2]

Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts the celebration of Bastille Day in Paris. It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 July Fourteenth, Rue Daunou, 1910 depicts the celebration of Bastille Day from the artist's viewpoint on top of the Hôtel l’Empire in Paris. The street below is thronged with automobiles and people, while the flags of France, Belgium, and the United States are being flown on various buildings. The Metropolitan Museum of Art considers the painting to be a precursor to Hassam's famous Flag Series.[1]

This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote: 74. TWO FIGURES AND A DOG IN A BEDROOM. De G. 71.[1] A woman stands at a window to the right; a man sits to her left beckoning to a dog. On the left is visible another room with gilt leather hangings. On the right is a bed, resembling that of the Rijksmuseum picture from the Van der Hoop collection (71), and having similar green curtains. This picture also is of the best period, about 1665, and recalls the larger picture in the Louvre (255). The figures are stiff. Canvas (?), 21 inches by 23 1/2 inches.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinshan_Island_and_West_Lake,Jinshan Island and West Lake,"Jinshan Island and West Lake (金山西湖図屏風) is a painting on six Byobu folding screens by Japanese artist Kanō Sanraku, the master of the Kano painting school. The artwork was created with ink, paint, gold and paper. It is part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.[1] Both are created with gold powder.
 Both parts of the screen depict the image of mountains and islands among the water and fog. They depict two geographically-distant and separate locations of eastern China. On the right side of the screen is Mount Jinshan located on the Yangtze River, near the city of Zhenjiang in southern Jiangsu province. Included in that painting are numerous bridges, roads and paths where people from all walks of life intersect.
 On the left side is West Lake, outside the city of Hangzhou. Sanraku depicted the walls and gates of this city in the foreground in the left corner. Buddhist monasteries and places of worship were built in the area of the West Lake (some of them can be found on the mural of the screen), which attracted many pilgrims.[2] Many poets, scholars, and artists also lived there.[2] West Lake often appeared on the works of artists from the Southern Song. Sanraku added an iconographic ten species of West Lake for painting, which then became the motive of Chinese poetry and painting during the 12th and 13th centuries.
 Among Japanese works of art before Sanraku, the most famous was a vertical scroll attributed to Sassu. It later became clear that the author was his student Suugetsu. It is known that Sassu made a trip to West Lake, while Japanese artists of the Muromachi and Edo periods could create their works based solely on the works of their predecessors or on illustrations from books.[2] Only a few images of West Lake by Japanese artists contain ten species.[2]
 On both parts of the painting, from right to left, the seasons from spring to winter are portrayed. Both parts are combined using gold to create mist, water and parts in the background. Gold is worked to soften the composition of the transition from one type to another.[2]
 The seals of the artist, standing on the screen, indicate that the artwork was created at around 1630. At that time, Kanō Sanraku worked on murals at the Myoshinji Monastery in Kyoto, along with his adopted son, Kanō Sansetsu.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Socrates,The Death of Socrates,"The Death of Socrates (French: La Mort de Socrate) is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787. The painting was part of the neoclassical style, popular in the 1780s, that depicted subjects from the Classical age, in this case the story of the execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his Phaedo.[1]  In this story, Socrates has been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods, and has been sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock. Socrates uses his death as a final lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly. The Phaedo depicts the death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final days, which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.
 In the painting, an elderly Socrates is dressed in a white robe and sits upright on a bed, one hand extended over a cup, the other gesturing in the air; he is still teaching. He is surrounded by his friends of varying ages, most showing emotional distress, unlike Socrates, who remains calm. The young man handing him the cup looks the other way, with his face in his free hand. Crito listens intently to his teacher's words while clutching his knee. An elderly man, Plato, sits at the end of the bed, slumped over and looking in his lap. To the left, other men are seen through an arch set in the background wall.  On the stairway in the background, Socrates' wife Xanthippe, who had been dismissed earlier by her husband, takes a wistful glance backward at the scene.[2][3]
 David uses color to highlight the emotion in this painting. The shades of red are more muted on the edges of the painting and become more vibrant in the center, culminating in the dark red robe of the man holding the cup of poison, generally taken as offering the cup to Socrates rather than receiving it after Socrates had consumed its contents. The only two serene men, Socrates and Plato, are garbed in a contrasting bluish-white. The more muted color scheme of this painting may be a response to critics of David's Oath of the Horatii, who called his colors ""garish"".[4]
 David simplifies the scene by removing many characters originally described in the dialogues of Plato.  He also displayed some artistic license in representing the ages of many of the pupils of Socrates, including Plato.  Socrates, while elderly, is depicted as rather more handsome and fit than a 70-year old of his era would be in a more realistic depiction; his face is also much more idealized than the classical bust that is typically used as a reference portrait of Socrates.[2]  Plato would have been a young man at the time of Socrates's death, but in this painting he is the old man sitting at the foot of the bed.  David might have intended the painting to be set in Plato's imagination, where an elderly Plato attempts to conjure the scene in his imagination as he writes.[5]
 David signed this painting in two places; he put his full signature under Crito, the young man clutching Socrates's thigh, and his initials under Plato. David's signature placement often had symbolic meaning – for example, in his painting of Stanisław Kostka Potocki, David signed in the collar of the dog that is barking at the sitter. In Death of Socrates, his signatures also have meaning. His initials under Plato are a reference to the fact that the story comes from Plato, a thanks for the inspiration. His fuller signature under Crito means that this is the character whom the artist identifies most with. This may be a reference for Crito's position in the composition – clutching Socrates's thigh. In this way, David would be seen as a man who likewise clutches at the morals and values that Socrates represents.[1]
 Rather than a royal commission, David received a direct private commission for the work in 1786 from the wealthy Charles-Michel Trudaine de la Sablière, the youngest son of Trudaine de Montigny's [fr] and around 20 years old at the time.[a][7]  Trudaine was intrigued by a drama that Denis Diderot had considered writing but never completed.  One of the dramatic scenes that Diderot's unfinished did include was his death, which led to the commission for a painting.[8]  David's friend at the time André Chénier was also a member of the ""Trudaine society"" circle, and David appears to have followed Chénier's suggestions on matters such as the pose of Socrates in reaching out for the cup while still teaching.[8]  More generally, Socrates was a popular subject at the time as an example of Enlightenment values: a man who kept to the truth with admirable rationality and self-control.[2]
 David had created an initial treatment as early as 1782, and he returned to this early composition now that he had a commission.  He consulted Father Jean Adry, a Hellenist and scholar on the subject, on the circumstances of Socrates death.[3] One of Adry's letters has survived; he recommended that Plato should be shown as immobile (although Plato was not actually present), that Crito be shown with more emotion, and that Apollodorus (on the extreme right in the painting) should be visibly filled with emotion.[9]
 It was during David's first trip to Rome that he began to study the depiction of funerary scenes and to draw many examples. Many of David's major works stem from these funerary drawings.[10] In The Death of Socrates, David examines a philosopher's approach to death. Socrates is stoic and calm because he sees death as a separate, actual realm, a different state of being from life but not an end to being.[11]  In the painting, Socrates's gesture shows us that he is still teaching, even in the moment before his death.[7]
 Pierre Peyron, a contemporary of David's, also painted an artistic rendition of the Death of Socrates around 1787.  Both Peyron's version and David's version were displayed at the same Salon of 1787.  The two had something of a rivalry before, with both hoping to become Director of the French Academy in Rome when the position next opened; the critics felt the two paintings decisively settled the matter in favor of David.  Count Potocki derisively stated that Peyron's work ""has shown up the quality of David's picture by proving to the public how far beneath him one could be"".[9][2]
 Another painting depicting the death of Socrates was done by the Italian artist Giambettino Cignaroli in the first half of the 18th century. Cignaroli's work shows Socrates already dead, surrounded by his anguished followers.
 Yet another depiction of Socrates' death was done by the French artist Jacques-Philippe-Joseph de Saint-Quentin. The work, currently housed at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, dates to circa 1762.
 David debuted the painting at the Paris Salon of 1787, the official art exhibition.  The painting received prompt acclaim among David's contemporaries.  The English painter Joshua Reynolds wrote that The Death of Socrates was ""the greatest work of art since the Sistine Chapel and Raphael's Stanze in the Vatican.""[9]  The American minister to France, Thomas Jefferson, wrote that the painting was the best work at the Salon of 1787, and that the painting was ""superb"".[2]  The painting was sufficiently successful that David showed it again at the Salon of 1791; it still attracted interest due to the changed political environment, as heroic stories from an earlier age fit the mood of the early French Revolution.[2]
 An 1826 exhibition intended to raise money for the Greek War of Independence displayed much of David's work at the Galerie Lebrun, including The Death of Socrates.  The exhibition attracted much interest due to a backlash from the post-Bourbon Restoration royalist government, which disliked David and had refused permission for his body to be buried in France, albeit more for his Revolutionary-era paintings than Socrates.[12]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Playing_with_a_Goat,Children Playing with a Goat,"Children Playing with a Goat is an 18th-century grisaille painting in the style of Jacob de Wit, known as a ""witje"". It is an oil painting on canvas depicting a relief of children playing with a goat after a relief by Francois Duquesnoy. It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[1]
 Several paintings  of this specific scene dating from the 17th century and 18th century have survived, and sometimes these were incorporated into other paintings. Though the paintings themselves have survived, the interpretation has not. In general, the popularity of putti in ""witjes"" as overdoors or room panels had to do with a trompe-l'œil effect when the viewer walks into a room. Stucco work as a decorative scheme was quite popular in the Netherlands from the late 17th century throughout the 18th century, but these imitation-stucco paintings were valued for their cleverness, their clarity even on a cloudy day without shadows, and of course the ease with which they could be moved and reinstalled, an aspect which has made them also difficult to trace. In fact, the genre itself existed well before De Wit was active and they were just called ""grauwtjes"" (little grays, or grisailles), and through De Wit's art they slowly became known as ""witjes"" (little whites).  The shadows in the painting are supposed to be aligned with the light source, so in this case, the painting was probably an overdoor with a window on the left. The painter Jacob de Wit excelled at this ""painting of putti in a bas-relief"" style of grisaille, and though no original autograph version of this specific scene is known, the art historian Hessel Miedema discovered two ""grauwtjes"" by De Wit after reliefs by Duquesnoy in the estate sale of Lambert ten Kate.[2] According to Walter Liedtke, a comparison of this painting with autograph ""witjes"", however, shows that it is not as masterful as an actual Jacob de Wit.
 The reason this painting is important for the art historical record has therefore more to do with its subject than with its painterly qualities. Indeed, the subject is featured in another painting owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, namely their self-portrait by Gerard Dou. This painting came into the collection via the John Pierpont Morgan bequest, and the Dou was bequeathed by Benjamin Altman. In Dou's case, he painted this scene several times in the lower ""balcony"" part of his popular ""niche paintings"" and the art historian Hofstede de Groot would just refer to it as ""well-known relief by Duquesnoy of children playing with a he-goat"".[3]
 Known versions by Dou:
 The popularity of ""witjes"" as a decorative element, but also as a collector's item, caused De Wit to have many followers, including Piat Sauvage, who also created a copy of the same Children Playing with a Goat theme.[4] Two of Sauvage's trompe-l'œil bas-reliefs are also in the J.P. Morgan bequest, though it is unknown whether Morgan knew about Sauvage's copy of the other painting in his collection:
 The subject remained popular through the 19th century, when it was used by the sculptor P.E. van den Bossche for a sculpted frieze above the doors of a building on the Prinsengracht in Amsterdam.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_the_Tuileries_on_a_Winter_Afternoon,The Garden of the Tuileries on a Winter Afternoon,"The Garden of the Tuileries on a Winter Afternoon is a late 19th-century painting by French artist Camille Pissarro. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts the Tuileries Garden and surrounding landmarks in Paris. The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
 Pissarro's work depicts the Tuileries garden, a public space built on the site of the destroyed Tuileries Palace in Paris. The view depicted in Garden is likely from 204 Rue de Rivoli, where Pissarro had secured an apartment. Notable Parisian landmarks seen in the painting include the steeples of Sainte-Clotilde and the Dôme des Invalides.[1] The painting is part of a series of eight cityscapes produced by Pissarro from 1898 to 1900.[2]
 Garden was initially given as a gift by Pissarro to the family of Impressionist painter Alfred Sisley (died 1899) to support them. The painting was then owned by a number of private collectors before being donated to the Met by Katrin S. Vietor (in memory of Ernest G. Vietor) in 1966.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Funeral_(painting),The Funeral (painting),"The Funeral (French –  L'Enterrement) is an 1867–1870 oil on canvas painting by Édouard Manet, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Incomplete, its style is very close to that of Effect of Snow on Petit-Montrouge and The Exposition Universelle of 1867 (Rouart, Widenstein 1975 no. 123). It is also known as Burial at the Glacière (Enterrement à la Glacière), the title given to it in Denis Rouart and Daniel Wildenstein's posthumous inventory of Manet's works.[1]
 The work was sold by Suzanne Manet to the art dealer Portier in August 1894 for 300 francs. In 1902 it is recorded as owned by Camille Pissarro, who had known Manet well and frequented the Café Guerbois. The painting was next acquired by Ambroise Vollard, who sold it to its present owner for $2,319.[2]
 It shows a hearse and its attendants at the bottom of the quartier Mouffetard, heading for the Montparnasse Cemetery, with the Observatoire de Paris, église Notre-Dame du Val-de-Grâce, the Panthéon, the bell tower of the église Saint-Étienne-du-Mont and the tour Clovis (now the lycée Henri-IV) in the distance.[3] Charles Sterling-Salinger notes that Manet has brought the domes of the Observatoire of the église Notre-Dame du Val-de-Grâce closer together to improve the composition.[4] According to Adolphe Tabarant, the scene is set in the rue de l'Estrapade.[5] Tabarant initially dated the work to 1870, but later amended this to the earlier date, which he felt more probable. Due to the presence of a horse grenadier of the Imperial Guard at the back of the procession, Henri Loyrette argues that the scene is set before the end of the French Second Empire.[6]
 The work was most probably inspired by the funeral of the painter's friend Charles Baudelaire on 2 September 1867, at which Manet had assisted.[3] The weather was stormy that day, the sky heavy and the cortège small because – according to Charles Asselineau – many people were absent from Paris and could not return in time. On their return, about a hundred people were in the church and at the Montparnasse Cemetery.[7]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cup_of_Tea,The Cup of Tea,"The American artist Mary Cassatt painted The Cup of Tea in Paris ca. 1879–1881. The painting depicts Mary's sister Lydia Cassatt in a typical, upper class-Parisian ritual of afternoon tea.[1] Scholars have observed that Cassatt's choice to employ vivid colors, loose brushstrokes, and unique perspective to portray the scene makes it a quintessentially Impressionist painting.[1]
 It is unclear when this painting was first exhibited. The painting is mentioned in Edgar Degas’s preliminary list of works for the Impressionist Exhibition of 1879. However, the post-exhibition catalog did not include The Cup of Tea.[1] It was confirmed to have appeared in the Sixth Impressionist Exhibit of 1881 where it received much praise as well as criticism. The painting was later purchased by a retired American banker and friend of the Cassatt family, James Stillman. Today, the painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.[2]
 Cassatt was born in the United States in 1844 to parents Robert and Catherine Cassatt. She began her art career at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1861 at the age of seventeen. Cassatt was dissatisfied with her art education and yearned to continue her career abroad. Her father was hesitant at first. He was concerned that it was inappropriate for his daughter of “means and social position” to pursue an artistic career.[3] He eventually gave in, and the Cassatt family ended up following Mary to Paris to live with her.
 Scholars have often seen paintings such as The Cup of Tea as an extension of Cassatt's social identity, but their interpretations differ. In his study of the artist, Frederick Sweet emphasized the importance of ""the environment in which she lived and worked” and treated works such as The Cup of Tea as a natural extension of Cassatt's bourgeois milieu.[3] The art historian Griselda Pollock, however, has emphasized the constraints that this identity imposed on Cassatt's choice of subject matter, observing that “for bourgeois women, going into town mingling with crowds of mixed social composition was not only frightening because it became increasingly unfamiliar, but because it was morally dangerous.”[4] Pollock argues that Cassatt would not have been able to access the same spaces as her male counterparts for concerns of safety and for her social standing. In addition to it being dangerous for a woman to go out alone in the city to paint, it would not have been socially acceptable for women to insert herself into spaces that did not align with her social status.[4]
 The scene shown in The Cup of Tea is a depiction of Mary Cassatt's sister Lydia partaking in a daily ritual exclusive to upper-class Parisian women.[5] The gold-edged teacup along with the silver spoon are luxury items that indicate the high social status of the subject depicted.[6] Lydia's hat and gloves reinforce the formality of the scene, and additionally suggest that she is a guest taking tea in another woman's home. Behind Lydia sits a green wicker planter full of white hyacinth flowers. Hyacinths typically represent beauty and pride, which further underscores the poise and elegance of the overall scene.[3]
 In their book on the paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, John K. Howat and Natalie Spassky explain how The Cup of Tea exemplifies Cassatt's “commitment to Impressionism.”[1] The depiction of the subject as well as the deliberate brushwork and coloring align with the Impressionist “idiom.” While the painting presents a central figure (Lydia), this figure is not depicted in a typical portrait format. The awkward vantage point and cropping of the frame along with the off center placement of Lydia suggest that this painting is not primarily focused on the subject, but rather that it is focused on the scene as a whole.[1]
 Frederick Sweet further explains how the eloquent brushstrokes dissolve the line between subject and background and encourage the viewer to see the painting as an “overall conception,” not as a portrait.[3] John K. Howat goes on to write how colors are used to define objects and how the brushstrokes unite the composition. He claims that the use of the color pink throughout the composition ties the scene together. The light pink tones of the dress are mimicked on the underside of the chair and the saucer as well as by the gloves, woman's face, and the flowers. “Measured strokes of local” and contrasting colors are additionally used for shadows to “accentuate form” in this piece. For example, the white gloves are spotted with blue strokes that more clearly define their form. At the same time, these gloves are made up of “measured” brushstrokes of the recurring pink and white colors to maintain the sense of fluency throughout the piece, consistent with the Impressionist movement.[1]
 Helene Barbara Weinberg describes the space in the painting as “undefined.” Weinberg sees no clear boundaries between foreground and background and explains how this invokes a feeling of disorientation in the viewer. Weinberg suggests that the “protective embrace by a deep upholstered chair” offers a counterpoint to the spatial disorientation, grounding the viewer.[6] Weinberg calls further attention to the artist's selective use of detail: “Cassatt’s emphasis on unexceptional details and events of daily life reflect her concern for anecdote rather than elaborate narrative.”[6]
 Gustave Geffroy, a French art critic, praised Mary Cassatt's The Cup of Tea in an 1881 issue of the journal La Justice: “We prefer above all the woman in the pink dress and bonnet who holds a cup of tea in her gloved hands.” Geffroy goes on to write that Lydia is “exquisitely Parisian,” having been depicted with various nuances in color, texture, and lighting. He states that the variations of pink along with the free-flowing lace display a sense of ""playful"" femininity. He additionally admires how Cassatt uses reflection of light to highlight the clothing Lydia is wearing. Geffroy concludes by explaining how these artistic details come together to create “a delicious work.”[7]
 Charles-Albert d’Arnoux—otherwise known as Bertall, a French illustrator—takes a more critical stance toward The Cup of Tea in Paris-Journal in April 1881. He writes that the painting is “badly drawn and badly painted” and that “without color or modeling” this work is “inconsistent both in tone and form.”[7] Rather than considering the possibility that Cassatt may have purposefully depicted her subject in this way, Bertall sees the style as being a reflection of Cassatt's lack of talent as an artist. By describing the whole of Cassatt's works as “unrealistic,” Bertall further refuses the possibility that this way of painting may have been intentional. Describing Cassatt's choice of subject matter, he writes: “we are not going to try to describe the confusion of women and young ladies in pink, fanning themselves in their chairs.” He further criticizes Cassatt's female subjects as being uninteresting and unimportant, describing them as merely “fanning themselves in their chairs.”[7]
 Henry Trianon offers a more ambiguous opinion in Le Constitutionnel on April 24, 1881, writing “Mary Cassatt, an English or American woman as her name indicates, also pays tribute to the sketch. Sometimes, however, she achieves an effect, almost a painting.”[7] He even goes on to say that the pot of flowers sitting behind the subject “adds its brilliant note to the charm of the overall tonality” of the work.[7]
 In a short comment in L’art moderne, Joris-Karl Huysmans admires the “smiling woman dressed in pink” who sits in her large chair and holds a “little teacup in her gloved hands.” Huysmans's response praises this stereotypically feminine scene as well as Cassatt's use of techniques to accentuate the unique environment. He claims that the gloved hands and little teacup along with the use of pinks and bright colors add “the fine odor of Parisian elegance to the overall tender and peaceful air.”["

The two players are Bertrand Gardel (at left), an elderly French teacher, and the somewhat younger George Holmes, a painter.  The men are in a dark, wood-panelled Victorian parlour with a quality of light suggesting late afternoon. The game is well in progress, as many pieces have been removed from the board. Holmes, the younger player, seems to be winning the match, as he has taken the queen of his opponent (the top of which pokes out of the table's drawer), and his own black queen is well-positioned in the centre of the board. Eakins painted The Chess Players for his father, and signed the painting in Latin, ""BENJAMINI. EAKINS. FILIUS. PINXIT. '76""—""the son of Benjamin Eakins painted this""—in small letters on the drawer of the table. Michael Clapper of Franklin & Marshall College has noted, ""Eakins’s choice of [chess] and his knowledgeable treatment of it suggest that he was familiar with and interested in the game, though there is little direct evidence of it apart from the painting.""[1]
 Art historian Akela Reason proposes that the painting is a tribute to a number of the artist's father-figures: Holmes probably was Eakins's first art teacher; Gardel was his French teacher; Benjamin Eakins was his literal father; and Jean-Léon Gérôme, his master at the École des Beaux-Arts, is represented by a print of Ave Caesar Morituri te Salutant, over the clock.[2]
 Author Martin Berger has analyzed the content of the painting in detail, finding it an evocation of the passage of time and ascribing it a highly personal meaning in Eakins' life. The younger chess player's attempt to kill the older player's king is analogous to the Oedipal complex. In the way that his father Benjamin is placed in opposition to Eakins the painter, the two may be envisioned as playing out a psychological ""conflict"" across the other axis of the chess board. In this light it is not coincidental that the painting was made on wood panel rather than canvas. While Eakins has humbled himself before his father in signing the painting only by reference to being Benjamin's son, he also presents his father ambivalently. Elevating his father's status, he places Benjamin centrally, with the vanishing point behind Benjamin's head. Yet Eakins has obscured his father's face by shadow and by the angle at which he looks down upon the game. Although the painting was dedicated to Benjamin, the title ""The Chess Players"" curiously leaves Eakins' father out of the narrative of the picture.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage_Self-Portrait,Camouflage Self-Portrait,"Self-Portrait is a 1986 work by the American artist Andy Warhol.[1]  The portrait is in a camouflage-patterned foreground with a black background.
 Andy Warhol made Self-portrait a few months before his death, which was in February 1987.[1]
 It uses a Polaroid photograph of him, with the material of acrylic polymer paint and silk screen printing[2] to produce a camouflage pattern over the face surrounded by black.
 The Metropolitan Museum of Art describes the image: ""Warhol appears as a haunting, disembodied mask. His head floats in a dark black void and his face and hair are ghostly pale, covered in a militaristic camouflage pattern of green, gray, and black.""[1]
 There is a contrast between the impersonality of the camouflage pattern, which hints at danger, and the personality of the portrait tradition, where there is direct contact with the viewer, although in this case with a protective illusory covering.[2]  The ambiguous uses of camouflage—drawing attention when a fashionable look and doing the opposite in military use—fascinated Warhol.[2]
 A version in the Philadelphia Museum of Art uses pink and magenta on the same black background.[2] Another version similar to the one kept at the Philadelphia Museum of Art is part of the National Gallery of Victoria's modern art collection.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_Fair,The Horse Fair,"The Horse Fair is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Rosa Bonheur, begun in 1852 and first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1853. The artist added some finishing touches in 1855. The large work measures 96.25 in × 199.5 in (244.5 cm × 506.7 cm).[1]
 The painting depicts dealers selling horses at the horse market held on the Boulevard de l'Hôpital in Paris. The hospital of Salpêtrière can be seen in the left background.
 The prime version of the painting has been in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since 1887, when it was donated by Cornelius Vanderbilt II. It is on view in Gallery 812. A smaller version is on display at the National Gallery in London.[2]
 Bonheur painted 'The Horse Fair' from a series of sketches of Percherons, and other draft horses, which she had made at the Paris horse market [fr] on the tree-lined Boulevard de l'Hôpital, near the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital,[3] which is visible in the background to the painting.  She attended the market twice weekly for a year and a half from summer of 1850 to the end of 1851.  She sought a permission de travestissement [fr] from the Paris police to dress as a man, to avoid drawing attention to herself.[1] She had earlier studied at a Paris slaughterhouse in 1845, a typical activity for an animal painter that she was the first woman to engage in, and had experienced harassment as a visible woman.[4][self-published source]
 In addition to studies at the Paris horse market, she also  modeled her animals on those from the Paris Omnibus Company.[4]  She broke from tradition in depicting the horse eye as it is, rather than using anthropomorphism for emotional effect.[5] It has been suggested that one of the human figures is a self-portrait.
 Bonheur routinely wore masculine clothes at home and in the country. The Horse Fair is printed as Plate 18 in Germaine Greer's book The Obstacle Race, in which she writes: ""There was nothing titillating about the full trousers and painters' smocks that Bonheur wore"", and quotes the artist herself as saying:
 Among the influences on Bonheur's work are the painters George Stubbs, Théodore Géricault, and Eugène Delacroix, and sculpture from Ancient Greece.  She described the painting as her own Parthenon Frieze.  It is signed and dated, ""Rosa Bonheur 1853.5"".
 The painting was praised by the critics when it was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in May 1853.  Several commented on the masculine nature of the work.  Earlier, Bonheur had offered studies of two paintings to French Minister of Fine Arts Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny, for consideration of a state commission.  He selected the other work, Haymaking in the Auvergne, now held by the museum at the Château de Fontainebleau.  Bonheur rejected his attempt to change his mind after the 1853 exhibition.
 The painting was subsequently shown in Ghent in 1853 and then in Bordeaux in 1854, but the city declined to buy it for FF 15,000.   It was sold to the British art dealer Ernest Gambart in 1854 for FF 40,000.   Bonheur added finishing touches in 1855.
 It was shown at various locations during a tour of Britain in 1855 to 1857.  In London, the painting was shown in the home of Edwin Henry Landseer, the artist well known for his works on animals.[7] Queen Victoria requested a private viewing at Buckingham Palace.  It was the most acclaimed of Bonheur's works, and is described by the Metropolitan Museum as one of its best-known works of art.
 It was sold to cotton trader William Parkinson Wright in 1857 for FF 30,000, and then sold to Alexander Turney Stewart in 1866.  After the deaths of Stewart in 1876 and of his widow Cornelia in 1886, the painting was bought at auction by Cornelius Vanderbilt II for $53,000 in March 1887, and immediately donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.[1][8]
 The first engraving of the work was made by Jules Jacques Veyrassat during the Paris Salon of 1853, while the often-reproduced engraving by Thomas Landseer helped it achieve a wide popularity.  Landseer's engraving was based on a half-size replica, 48 in × 100 in (120 cm × 250 cm), c.1855, by Bonheur and her partner Nathalie Micas, which was donated to the National Gallery in London in 1859 from the estate of Jacob Bell.[1][9]
 Bonheur also made a second half-size replica, which she preferred, formerly in the collection of the McConnel family (owners of a cotton mill in Cressbrook, Derbyshire) and in the collection of Jack Wheeler by 1989, when it was exhibited at Meadows Museum in Dallas; and a third half-size replica made for Commander Arthur Hill Ommanney Peter Hill-Lowe RN in Somerset (first husband of Beatrice Hill-Lowe) was sold at Sotheby's in 1978, and is now in a private collection in Baton Rouge.  A fourth much smaller version, 19 in × 35 in (48 cm × 89 cm) was in the private collection of Karl Lowenstein.  An autograph watercolour version 24 in × 50 in (61 cm × 127 cm) dated 1867 was sold by Sotheby's in New York in 2007.[10]  A similar watercolour version was sold by Knoedler in 1982.
 Painter Molly Luce claimed that The Horse Fair was the first work which influenced her in her decision to become an artist,[11] and the work also inspired a young Wayne Thiebaud.[12][13]
 In the literary world, The Horse Fair inspired a 2000 anthology by poet Robin Becker.[14][15]
 The painting, with its large scale, realistic style, and strong sense of movement, can be considered proto-cinematic.[5][16][17]
 Bonheur's brother, Isidore Bonheur, cast a bronze relief plaque based on the painting for her monument at Fontainebleau.  The memorial included a large statue of a bull, on a pedestal with four relief plaques reproducing her most popular paintings; it was destroyed in 1941, but a cast of the plaque is held by the Dahesh Museum of Art in New York.[18]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heart_of_the_Andes,The Heart of the Andes,"The Heart of the Andes is a large oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the American artist Frederic Edwin Church (1826–1900). It depicts an idealized landscape in the South American Andes, where Church traveled on two occasions. Measuring more than five feet (1.5 meters) high and almost ten feet (3 meters) wide, its New York City exhibition in 1859 was a sensation, establishing Church as the foremost landscape painter in the United States.[1]
 The painting was later exhibited by itself in other eastern U.S. cities. The exhibition rooms featured special lighting and decorative elements reminiscent of the depicted landscape, and the painting was supported by a floor-standing frame. The public was often enchanted by the amount of detail portrayed in it, willing to wait in line and pay a 25-cent entrance fee. Church synthesized numerous topographies of the Andes into his composition, from Mount Chimborazo to a plain and a jungle. In the details, there are numerous animals and indications of human settlement, including people visiting a cross in the left foreground.
 The Heart of the Andes has been in the collection of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1909. Its first sale, to William Tilden Blodgett, broke a price record for a living American artist. It is among Church's most renowned works and an important 19th-century American painting.
 In 1853 and 1857, Church traveled in Ecuador and Colombia, financed by businessman Cyrus West Field, who wished to use Church's paintings to lure investors to his South American ventures. Church was inspired by the Prussian naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, and his 1845 treatise Kosmos. Humboldt was among the last of the great scientific generalists, and his fame became similar to that of Albert Einstein a century later.[2] In the second volume of Kosmos, Humboldt described the influence of landscape painting on the study of the natural world—holding that art is among the highest expressions of the love of nature[3]—and challenging artists to portray the ""physiognomy"" of the landscape.[2][4] Church retraced Humboldt's travels in South America.
 The Heart of the Andes is a composite of the South American topography observed during his travels. At the center right of the landscape is a shimmering pool served by a waterfall. The snow-capped Mount Chimborazo of Ecuador appears in the distance; the viewer's eye is led to it by the darker, closer slopes that decline from right to left. The evidence of human presence is shown by the lightly worn path, a hamlet and church lying in the central plain, and closer to the foreground, two locals are seen before a cross. The church, a trademark detail in Church's paintings, is Catholic and Spanish-colonial, and seemingly inaccessible from the viewer's location. Church's signature appears cut into the bark of the highlighted foreground tree at left. The play of light on his signature has been interpreted as the artist's statement of man's ability to tame nature—yet the tree appears in poor health compared to the vivid jungle surrounding it.[5]
 Church's landscape conformed to the aesthetic principles of the picturesque, as propounded by the British theorist William Gilpin, which began with a careful observation of nature enhanced by particular notions about composition and harmony. The juxtaposition of smooth and irregular forms was an important principle, and is represented in The Heart of the Andes by the rounded hills and pool of water on the one hand, and by the contrasting jagged mountains and rough trees on the other.[6]
 The theory of British critic John Ruskin was also an important influence on Church. Ruskin's Modern Painters was a five-volume treatise on art that was, according to American artist Worthington Whittredge, ""in every landscape painter's hand"" by mid-century.[7]  Ruskin emphasized the close observation of nature, and he viewed art, morality, and the natural world as spiritually unified. Following this theme, the painting displays the landscape in detail at all scales, from the intricate foliage, birds, and butterflies in the foreground to the all-encompassing portrayal of the natural environments studied by Church. The presence of the cross suggests the peaceful coexistence of religion with the landscape.[1]
 The Heart of the Andes was first exhibited publicly between April 29 and May 23, 1859, at New York's Tenth Street Studio Building, the city's first studio building designed for artists.[8] Church had exhibited single paintings previously, such as Niagara (1857), to much success. The event attracted an unprecedented turnout for a single-painting exhibition in the United States: more than 12,000 people paid an admission fee of twenty-five cents to view the painting. Even on the final day of the showing, patrons waited in line for hours to enter the Exhibition Room.[8][9]
 There is no record of the appearance or arrangement of the Studio Building exhibit. It has been widely claimed, although probably falsely, that the room was decorated with palm fronds and that gaslights with silver reflectors were used to illuminate the painting.[8] More certain is that the painting's casement-window–like ""frame"" had a breadth of fourteen feet and a height of almost thirteen, which further imposed the painting upon the viewer. It was likely made of brown chestnut, a departure from the prevailing gilt frame. The base of the edifice stood on the ground, ensuring that the landscape's horizon would be displayed at the viewer's eye level. Drawn curtains were fitted, creating the sense of a view out a window. A skylight directed at the canvas heightened the perception that the painting was illuminated from within, as did the dark fabrics draped on the studio walls to absorb light. Opera glasses were provided to patrons to allow examination of the landscape's details, and may have been necessary to satisfactorily view the painting at all, given the crowding in the exhibition room.[8]
 Church's canvas had a strong effect on its viewers; a contemporary witness wrote: ""women felt faint. Both men and women succumb[ed] to the dizzying combination of terror and vertigo that they recognize[d] as the sublime. Many of them will later describe a sensation of becoming immersed in, or absorbed by, this painting, whose dimensions, presentation, and subject matter speak of the divine power of nature.""[6]
 Accompanying the admission were two pamphlets about the painting: Theodore Winthrop's A Companion to The Heart of the Andes and the Reverend Louis Legrand Noble's Church's Picture, The Heart of the Andes. In the manner of travel guides, the booklets provided a tour of the painting's varied topography. An excerpt from Noble reads:
 Imagine yourself, late in the afternoon with the sun behind you, to be travelling up the valley along the bank of a river, at an elevation above the hot country of some five or six thousand feet. At the point to which you have ascended, heavily-wooded mountains close in on either hand, (not visible in the picture – only the foot of each jutting into view,) richly clothed with trees and all the appendage of the forest, with the river flowing between them. ... Conspicuous on the opposite side of the river is the road leading into the country above, a wild bridle-path in the brightest sunshine, winding up into, and losing itself in the thick shady woods.  The foreground ... forms of itself a scene of unrivalled power and brilliancy, ...[8] Church wanted Humboldt, his intellectual mentor, to see his masterpiece. Close to the end of the first exhibition, on May 9, 1859, he wrote of this desire to American poet Bayard Taylor:
 The ""Andes"" will probably be on its way to Europe before your return to the City ... [The] principal motive in taking the picture to Berlin is to have the satisfaction of placing before Humboldt a transcript of the scenery which delighted his eyes sixty years ago—and which he had pronounced to be the finest in the world.[3] Hum"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Scull_36_Times,Ethel Scull 36 Times,"Ethel Scull 36 Times is a 1963 painting by American artist Andy Warhol. It was Warhol's first commissioned work.[1][2][3] The work consists of four rows of nine equal columns,[4] depicting Ethel Redner Scull, a well-known collector of modern art.[5] The artwork is jointly owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[1]
 Ethel Scull (née Redner) was born in The Bronx, New York City in 1921. Her father was a wealthy taxi company owner.[5]
 Robert Scull was born in New York City to Russian immigrant parents who had anglicized their family name from Sokolnikoff.[6] His childhood was spent in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His interest in modern art began when he visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a ten-year-old boy.[7]
 Ethel Redner met Robert Scull, who was then a freelance illustrator, when she was studying at Parsons School of Design. They married in 1944.[5] When Ethel's father retired, he distributed shares of his business to his three sons-in-law. Robert Scull was one of the beneficiaries, and built up a prosperous business.[5]
 Robert Scull bought every work in Jasper Johns' first exhibition.[1] Ethel Scull 36 Times was Robert Scull's present to Ethel Scull on her 42nd birthday.[1] Once questioned by an interviewer regarding accusations that he and his wife bought art for investment and for social climbing, Robert Scull replied: ""It's all true. I'd rather use art to climb than anything else.""[8]
 In early 1963 Robert Scull asked Warhol to paint a portrait of his wife after the style of the Marilyn Diptych and Warhol's other depictions of Marilyn Monroe.[3][9] At the time, this was at the height of the Sculls' fame.[10] Warhol took Ethel Scull to a Times Square photo booth and prompted her to take 300 black and white photographs of herself. Warhol told her jokes in an effort to make her photographs more candid.[9] One hand-colored photo-strip from the session is in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum.[11]
 It has been reported that Warhol made around 1,000 portraits, many of them commissioned.[3] In 1974 he accepted a commission from Gunther Sachs to paint Sachs' then wife Brigitte Bardot, and then also produced a portrait of Sachs himself.[3] Other commissioned works include a 1985 portrait of Lana Turner paid for by the actress herself.[3]
 Ethel Scull 36 Times was Warhol's first commissioned portrait and the starting point in his business in making portraits at the request of wealthy celebrities.[1][3]
 Warhol's depictions of people were often created from photographs he found in printed media.[7] A movie poster was used for the Marilyn Diptych.[9] Ethel Scull 36 Times was the first time Warhol created a photo-based work using images he had created.[7]
 After divorcing his wife, Robert Scull claimed ownership of the painting. Ethel Scull claimed the art work was a gift given to her by her then husband, and was her possession. The artwork is now currently shared between the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aegean_Sea,The Aegean Sea,"The Aegean Sea is a c. 1877 oil painting by American artist Frederic Edwin Church, and one of his last large-scale paintings.
 The painting measures 54 by 84.25 inches (137.2 cm × 214.0 cm).  It is a capriccio inspired by Church's travels to Europe and the Middle East from 1867 to 1869.  The composite image includes elements from sketches that Church made in different locations, including a rock-cut entrance from Petra in a cliff to the left, fallen capitals from the Temple of Bacchus at Baalbek in the lower left, Roman columns from Syria to the right, and in the distance across a body of water lie classical ruins that resemble the Acropolis of Athens or the Temple of Apollo [it; el; nl; fi] in Ancient Corinth, and the dome and minaret of a mosque from Istanbul.  In the foreground are three small human figures in conversation beside a road based on an oil study of three Bedouins.  The cloudy sky is enlivened by a double rainbow.[1]
 In this work, Church moved away from his usual naturalistic style to a more idealised style.  The  atmospheric effects that may be inspired by the paintings of J. M. W. Turner which Church had seen in London (although Church had already used a double rainbow in his 1866 painting Rainy Season in the Tropics).  The work may also take inspiration from Turner's 1826 view of the Roman Forum.  Church designed a gilded frame for the painting, decorated with an eclectic mixture of Middle Eastern motifs, including stars and rosettes, and egg-and-dart and other moldings.[2]
 The painting was bought by the railway tycoon William H. Osborn, a close friend and supporter of Church, and bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the death of his wife Virginia Reed (Sturges) Osborn in 1902.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome_(painting),Ancient Rome (painting),"Ancient Rome is a trio of almost identical paintings by Italian artist Giovanni Paolo Panini, produced as pendant paintings to Modern Rome for his patron, the comte de Stainville, in the 1750s.[3]
 The paintings depict many of the most significant architectural sites and sculptures from ancient Rome, such as the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Laocoön and His Sons, the Farnese Hercules, the Apollo Belvedere and the Borghese Gladiator.[4] Both Panini and Stainville are featured: Stainville stands holding a guidebook, while Panini appears behind Stainville's armchair.[3][4]
 The three versions of Ancient Rome, in order of creation, are located in the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Louvre in Paris.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Louvre each hold a version of Panini's companion piece, Modern Rome; and the third version is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
 In 1749, Giovanni Pannini painted the Gallery of Cardinal Silvio Valenti-Gonzaga, a painting representing Silvio Valenti-Gonzaga inside a huge gallery whose walls are covered with reproductions of the paintings he owns.[5] This composition, featuring an imaginary architecture dedicated to the exhibition of an artistic collection, is the basis of the Gallery of Views.[6]
 Between 1753 and 1757, Count Étienne François de Choiseul, Louis XV's ambassador to Rome in the 1740s, commissioned four paintings from Pannini: the Galleries of Views of Ancient Rome[7] and Modern Rome,[8] a view of the Place Saint-Peter and an Interior of St. Peter's Basilica.[9] These paintings were made between 1754 and 1757. In 1757, the Comte de Choiseul commissioned a second execution of these four paintings from him.
 In 1758-1759, Pannini produced another version of the two Galleries on behalf of Claude-François de Montboissier de Canillac de Beaufort, abbot of Canillac and charge d'affaires at the French embassy in Rome. These versions are not identical to the previous ones: the paintings and sculptures are not depicted as hanging in the same places, some are missing between the two versions and the figures do not occupy the same positions.

 The painted work consists primarily of seven large pebbles, each with a different symbol that Dalí believed would come to pass as a result of the affair. 
 The piece uses pasted-on cutouts from a children's book, whose visual style bears a striking resemblance to the aesthetic of the painting itself.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approaching_Thunder_Storm,Approaching Thunder Storm,"Approaching Thunder Storm is an 1859 painting by American painter Martin Johnson Heade. It was his largest painting to date.[1] The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[2] It is praised for its dramatic depiction of the threatening mood of blackening skies and eerily illuminated terrain prior to the storm itself.[2] The painting has been connected to mounting tensions before the Civil War, which were often expressed in terms of natural imagery.[3][4]
 One of a series of paintings by Heade of coastal landscapes, this work was based on a sketch that Heade made of an approaching storm on Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Here, a fisherman sits by the shore watching the storm approach; there is a faint red bolt of lightning in the left part of the sky. To his left are a dog, an iron kettle, and a spread-out boat sail. Another fisherman is rowing toward the shore, having left his sailboat out on the bay. His placement in the composition helps provide a sense of distance and a narrative for the scene.[5]
 Strazdes suggests that ""Heade, by refusing to prettify his scenery by association, was attempting to inject into his artistic vision a serious, monumental simplicity it had not previously possessed.""[6] The composition is very open, as if seen through a wide-angle lens, and relatively empty. The swathes of dark color are novel for a landscape work. The long horizon is an influence from Heade's contemporary, Frederic Edwin Church (with whom he shared a studio),[7] as in paintings such as Niagara.[6]
 Numerous pentimenti suggest that Heade altered the composition over time; for example, the hills on the horizon were originally larger and more jagged.  Records suggest that Approaching Thunder Storm was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1860.[6] In 1868, Heade painted Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay, a similar composition.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Goldsmith_in_His_Shop,A Goldsmith in His Shop,"A Goldsmith in His Shop is a 1449 painting by Petrus Christus, a leading painter in Bruges.[1] It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is an oil painting on an oak panel that measures 100.1 x 85.8 cm (39 3/8 x 33 3/4 inches) overall and the painted surface is 98 x 85.2 cm (38 5/8 x 33 1/2 inches). An inscription at the bottom of the painting states ""m petr[vs] xpi me· ·fecit·ao 1449· (Master Petrus Christus made me in the year 1449)"". In addition, the inscription has an emblem of a clock with a mechanical linkage to a heart, Christus's emblem.[1]
 This painting is among the best known of the artist's work and a masterpiece of Northern Renaissance. It was possibly commissioned by the goldsmith's guild of Bruges as an advertisement.[2]
 In some sources, the title of the painting is A Goldsmith in His Shop, Possibly Saint Eligius (the patron saint of goldsmiths). The presence of a halo over the goldsmith's head suggested Saint Eligius. Later, it was determined that the halo was added after the work was painted and it was removed.[3]
 Petrus Christus worked from 1444 and died in Bruges in 1475 or 1476.[2][4]
 Maryan Ainsworth titles the painting Saint Eligius.[2] Saint Eligius is unique among the Christus' paintings in that it has an interesting inscription.[2] The inscription, 41 • petr xpi me • • fecit • a° 1449 •, is followed by a heart-shaped mark. The inscription uses the Burgundian batarde script, a style used on guild tablets of goldsmiths and manuscript illuminators. The notation preceding the name means the master's title and shows Christus's training. Although worn, the inscription has been characterized as beautifully executed. It is completely original. It coordinates with the lighting of the painting where on the left the signature is fainter as it is shadowed by the marriage girdle. It becomes brighter on the right.[2]
 While this painting is among the best known of the artist's work, it may also be the most puzzling. Some have suggested it is an actual wedding portrait. Max J. Friedlander proposed that the painting is simply of an ideal bridal couple. According to Panofsky, this explanation is consistent with a painting commissioned by a goldsmiths' guild to advertise its services to the community, particularly its participation in the sacraments of the church.[2]  in addition, the large size of the work suggests that it was too large for private use but was for public display.[2]
 The painting includes many details. On the right side hanging on the wall the artist included some diverse objects. One of the objects is a pair of  fossilized shark's teeth intended to represent ""serpents' tongues"". They were supposed to change color when put into poisoned liquids or foods. The teeth were combined with coral in decorative pieces to ward off evil. They would be an advertisement to present the secular and religious services of gold and silversmiths to the community. In addition the painting shows the raw materials and finished work of the trade. The raw materials are the coral, crystal, porphyry, seed pearls, precious stones, and beads while the finished brooches, rings, and a belt buckles represented products of the trade.[2]
 Two men are reflected in the mirror on the workbench. One carries a falcon, a symbol of greed and pride. The mirror is an attribute of Superbia, referring to pride and vanity and one of the Seven Deadly Sins. An alternative view is suggested by the devout couple and the goldsmith/saint. The goldsmith has scales tipped toward the righteous, the couple, and may be indicating that the couple's virtue outweighs the vices of the men in the mirror.
 This painting is a masterpiece of Northern Renaissance art. After Jan van Eyck, Christus was the leading painter in Bruges, which is located in Flanders.[1]
 He was born in 1410 in Baerle on the Dutch/Belgian border.[5]  Christus obtained his citizenship about three years after van Eyck’s death. Scholars assume he managed van Eyck’s workshop for the three years then working independently as a free citizen. As a free citizen he could be accepted in the Guild of St. Luke, also known as the corporation of image-makers.[5]
 There were three ways of becoming a free citizen. He could marry a citizen of Bruges. He also could live in the city for a year and a day. Or finally, he could buy his citizen rights.[5] According to records from the Poorterboek (burgher's lodge[2]) in the town of Bruges in 1444 he bought his citizenship for three pounds on July 6 that year.[6]  His citizenship classified him as a free citizen so he could be accepted in the Guild of St. Luke and could sell his work.[5]
 In 1462–63 he and his wife became members of the Bruges Confraternity of Our Lady of the Dry Tree (referring to infertility of the Virgin's mother, Saint Anne).[2] Membership reflected the very high social status its artist-members had achieved. Christus was respected and served as a member of the confraternity board. Royal and upper class members included Phillip the Good and Phillip the Fair as wells as important people from other countries.[2] As evidence of his elevated status, Christus received important commission from the Bruges city magistrate.[2]
 The records of the Confraternity suggest that he died in 1475-76.[2]
 In the past the figure at the workbench was thought to be Saint Eligius, the patron saint of goldsmiths, due to the presence of a halo and the seated person being a goldsmith. In 1993, the halo was recognized as a later addition and removed. In 1998, Martha Wolff and Hugo van der Velden each observed that the painting had none of the common aspects of a saint.[3] Often, he is portrayed doing miracles and the goldsmith is not; he is working at his craft. They were able to convince others that the connection of the goldsmith with Saint Eligius occurred in modern times. Early commentaries refer to the painting as showing a goldsmith at his bench. Only starting in 1817 was the sitter characterized as “a goldsmith or rather the patron of goldsmiths—Saint Eligius.” The halo may have been added then when a new gold frame was added to the painting.[3]
 Others have suggested that there is no reason to believe that the goldsmith is St. Eligius. The expensively dressed young couple are individualized and appear to be the goldsmith’s desired customers.[7]
 The Dutch art historian Hugo van der Velden thinks the main figure may be the famous goldsmith Willem van Vleuten, goldsmith to Phillip the Good, who by then lived in Bruges.[3]
 In 1435 Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy entered into a treaty to end the conflict between the Burgundians and the French. Starting then Philip created a strong central government in part by limiting the authority of the larger cities under his control, including Bruges.[2]
 In July 1436, Bruges and other cities helped Phillip in his siege of some cities. About the same time, several merchants in Sluis, the port used by Bruges, were killed. The merchants were trade partners between the Netherlands and England and thus important to trade with England. After the murders, trade with England was stopped, resulting in unemployment and loss of income from exported wool and a shortage of food supply from English wheat.[2]
 Leaders in Bruges tried to expand their control over the city.  In an effort to regain control, Philip the Good laid siege to Bruges in May 1437. A famine resulted from the failure of the wheat crop in the region and the lack of wheat from England. When the plague arrived in June 1437 and killed one-fifth of the city population, the city surrendered and pledged its allegiance to Philip.[2]
 For the next 40 years the city was loyal to its sovereign, Phillip the Good. Petrus Christus began his active period during these 40 years.[2] The economy thrived between 1440 and 1473 so the market for Christus' art was strong in Flanders during these years. By the 1400s Bruges was an important center for producing illuminated psalters. Of all the Netherl"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain_%C3%A0_la_Grenouill%C3%A8re,Bain à la Grenouillère,"Bain à la Grenouillère is an 1869 painting by the French impressionist painter, Claude Monet. (Oil on canvas, 74.6 cm x 99.7 cm). It depicts ""Flowerpot Island"", also known as the Camembert, and the gangplank to La Grenouillère, a floating restaurant and boat-hire on the Seine at Croissy-sur-Seine. He was accompanied by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who also painted the scene at the same time.
 Monet wrote on September 25, 1869 in a letter to fellow artist Frédéric Bazille, ""I do have a dream, a painting (tableau), the baths of La Grenouillère, for which I have made some bad sketches (pochades), but it is only a dream.[1] Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who has just spent two months here, also wants to do this painting."" Monet and Renoir, both desperately poor, were quite close at the time.[2]
 The painting here and one in the London National Gallery (Bathers at La Grenouillere, oil on canvas, 73 x 92 cm) are probably the sketches mentioned by Monet in his letter. A bigger size painting, now lost but formerly in the Arnhold collection in Berlin, may well have been the ""tableau"" that he dreamed of.[3] The broad, constructive brushstrokes here are clearly those of a sketch. For his exhibition pictures Monet usually sought a more delicate and carefully calibrated surface at this time. An almost identical composition of the same subject by Renoir, La Grenouillère, is in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. The two friends were undoubtedly working side by side.
 La Grenouillère was a popular middle-class resort consisting of a spa, a boating establishment and a floating café. Optimistically promoted as ""Trouville-sur-Seine"", it was located on the Seine near Bougival, easily accessible by train from Paris and had just been favoured with a visit by Emperor Napoleon III with his wife and son. Monet and Renoir both recognized in La Grenouillère an ideal subject for the images of leisure they hoped to sell.
 La Grenouillère is the setting for Guy de Maupassant's 1881 short story ""La femme de Paul"". It is described as a place where ""we smell, deep in our nostrils, the  world's froth, all its distinguished scoundrels, the mould of Parisian society: a mixture of salesmen, show offs, lowly journalists, chaperoned young men, corrupt amateurs of the stock exchange, cretinous party animals, desiccated old pleasure seekers; a shady crowd of all suspect beings, half well known, half lost, half greeted, half dishonoured, swindlers, rascals, suppliers of women, lords of industry with a dignified look, the look of a blusterer which seems to be saying: ""The first one that calls me a rogue, I'll bust him"".""[4]
 As in his earlier picture of the Garden at Sainte-Adresse, Monet concentrated on repetitive elements – the ripples on the water, the foliage, the boats, the human figures – to weave a fabric of brushstrokes which, although emphatically brushstrokes, retain a strong descriptive quality.
 The painting is now in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was bequeathed by Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer in 1929.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_before_the_Battle_of_Trenton,General George Washington at Trenton,"General George Washington at Trenton is a large full-length portrait in oil painted in 1792 by the American artist John Trumbull of General George Washington at Trenton, New Jersey, on the night of January 2, 1777, during the American Revolutionary War. This is the night after the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, also known as the Second Battle of Trenton, and before the decisive victory at the Battle of Princeton the next day.[1] The artist considered this portrait ""the best certainly of those which I painted.""[2][3] The portrait is on view at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut, an 1806 gift of the Society of the Cincinnati in Connecticut.[2] It was commissioned by the city of Charleston, South Carolina, but was rejected by the city, resulting in Trumbull painting another version.[3]
 The work was commissioned by the city of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1792 to commemorate President Washington's visit there in May 1791 during his Southern Tour.[2][4] Trumbull had visited Charleston earlier, in February 1791, to paint portraits of several leaders, including Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.[4] Trumbull took the commission from William Loughton Smith, a representative of South Carolina and representing Charleston, con amore (with love), to paint Washington ""in the most sublime moment ... the evening previous to the battle of Princeton"".[3][5]
 General George Washington is in full military uniform, a blue coat over buff waistcoat and pants. He holds a spyglass in his right hand and a sword in his left hand. Behind him is Blueskin, his spirited, light-colored horse, restrained by a groom. Further in the distance is the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and nearby mill, along with artillery and campfires.[6]
 After Smith rejected the painting, Trumbull painted a similar, but different version for the city, entitled Washington at the City of Charleston. It was now set at Charleston, with the city in the background, the Cooper River and boats in the middle ground, and local plants in the foreground. Washington is shown as Smith wanted, ""calm, tranquil, peaceful."" He wears gloves on both hands, holds a hat in his left hand which is shown resting on his sword, while holding a walking stick with his right hand.[3][7] The painting is now on view in the Charleston City Hall.[7][8]
 Trumbull painted a much smaller version (26+1/2 inches (67 cm) x 18+1/2 inches (47 cm)), entitled George Washington before the Battle of Trenton, c. 1792–94, likely for his friend Charles Wilkes, a New York banker. It is similar to the original, but with changes in the background and a bay horse.[9] It was bequested to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1922 and is on view there.[10] In 1794, Trumbull went to London as secretary of legation for John Jay during the negotiations of the Jay Treaty. He had made a small version of this portrait and later supervised its engraving by Thomas Cheesman, entitled George Washington, in 1796. It was noted by historian Justin Winsor as the best engraving of Trumbull's paintings and was used as the basis for several other engravings.[11][12][13] In 1845, William Warner Jr. engraved Gen. Washington.[14] Illman & Sons engraved a version George Washington - On the Great Occasion of our Presidential Election in 1858.[15] Alfred Daggett engraved a version, Washington at Trenton, New Jersey, January 2d, 1777, that was published in Historical Collections of New Jersey, Past and Present by John W. Barber and Henry Howe in 1868.[16]  An engraving entitled, General Washington at the Bridge Over the Assunpink Creek, was published in the 1898 book, The Battles of Trenton and Princeton, by historian William S. Stryker.[17]
 
Trumbull described the thinking of Washington after seeing the superiority of the enemy at Trenton:  ... he is supposed to have been meditating how to avoid the apparently impending ruin. To re-cross the Delaware in the presence of such an enemy, was impossible; to retreat down the eastern side of the river, and cross at Philadelphia, was equally so; to hazard a battle on the ground, was desperate.[6]  Historian and painter William Dunlap after viewing it in the Trumbull Gallery at Yale said: ""This is, in many respects, a fine picture, and painted in the artist's best days.""[18]
 The United States Post Office has issued several postage stamps of George Washington from the portrait detail in this painting. The first was issued in 1860 with a ninety-cent value.[19][20] This stamp was revised and issued the next year, 1861.[21] In 1931, the Battle of Yorktown commemorative with a two-cent value included this portrait.[13][22] A stamp with a six-cent value was issued as part of the Washington Bicentennial stamps of 1932.[23][24] Finally, the Army and Navy Commemorative Series included a stamp with one-cent value in 1936.[13][25]
 On February 21, 1915, The New York Times published a full-page image of the painting with the caption ""General Washington, painted from life by his staff officer and friend, Col. John Trumbull"", in the Picture section, the first time in Rotogravure.[26]

 The subject, Herman Doomer, was a successful cabinetmaker and worker in ebony, which was fashionable in seventeenth-century Amsterdam. Rembrandt also painted a companion piece of his wife around the same time,  the Portrait of Baertje Martens, which is in the collection of the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia. The two pictures were left by Baertje Martens in her will in 1654 to their son, Lambert Doomer, an artist himself, on condition that he made copies of the two pieces for each of his brothers and sisters.
 The work is on view at the Metropolitan Museum in Gallery 964.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrance_to_a_Dutch_Port,Entrance to a Dutch Port,"Entrance to a Dutch Port is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch artist Willem van de Velde the Younger, created c. 1665. The painting depicts a bustling harbor in the Netherlands. The work is indicative of the historical mercantile power of the Netherlands during the 17th century. Entrance to a Dutch Port is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.[1][2]
 Entrance depicts a busy port in the Netherlands during the mid 17th century. The work is filled with details that would have been well known to Van de Velde (himself the son of a famous draftsman), such as a wooden breakwater and multiple types of ships. For the viewing audience, the painting evokes thoughts of a sunny, clear day in port with ships that have come safely home.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Actor_(painting),The Actor (painting),"The Actor (French: L'acteur) is an oil-on-canvas painting by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, created from 1904 to 1905.[1] The painting dates from the artist's Rose Period. It is housed in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
 From 1901 until 1904, Picasso's work had been dominated by his melancholy Blue Period, which was defined by predominantly blue paintings of human suffering. The Actor illustrates a shift in Picasso's artistic approach, which was influenced by his meeting of his new partner, Fernande Olivier in 1904. Olivier's presence and influence on the tone, subject matter and palette of Picasso's artwork is notable in the sheet of studies that he created for The Actor around the time of New Year's Eve in 1904, which features two profiles of Olivier.[2]
 Picasso painted The Actor during the winter of 1904 to 1905 when he was 23 years old.[3] The painting is a work of the artist's Rose Period when he changed his painting style from the downbeat tones of his Blue Period to warmer and more romantic hues.[1] It portrays an acrobat in a dramatic pose with an abstract design in the background. The canvas measures 196 centimetres (77 in) by 115 centimetres (45 in).[1] Picasso painted The Actor on the reverse side of a landscape painting by another artist because he could not afford new canvases at the time.[3]
 The Actor was produced at a transitional point in Picasso's artwork, when he became inspired by the lives of harlequins and saltimbanques. The Metropolitan Museum of Art summarises the importance of this painting in relation to his subsequent works about travelling circus performers.[2] Simple yet haunting, The Actor is the work with which Picasso ended his obsession with the wretched in favor of the theatrical world of acrobats and saltimbanques. Although the attenuated figure and extraordinary play of hands recall the El Greco-inspired mannerism of the Blue Period, The Actor can be seen as the prologue to the series of works that culminates in the enormous canvas Family of Saltimbanques. First owned by Picasso's friend Frank Burty Haviland[citation needed], it was sold in 1912 to Alice and Paul Friedrich Leffmann, originally of Cologne, Germany.[4] Its first public display was at the Sonderbund exhibition in May 1912 in Cologne.[4] In 1933, with Adolf Hitler's rise to power the conditions for Jews in Germany worsened. The Leffmanns, a German Jewish couple, suffered the Aryanization of their home and businesses by the Nazis.   The couple fled Germany in 1937 to Italy, and in 1938 to Switzerland and then to Brazil.[5] The Leffmanns sold the painting in June 1938,[4] for $13,200, to art dealers Paul Rosenberg and Hugo Perls, to fund their escape from the Nazis.[5][6] The painting eventually was purchased in 1941 by heiress Thelma Chrysler Foy, the daughter of Walter Chrysler of the Chrysler automobile company, from the Knoedler gallery in New York, for $22,500.[5][1] She donated it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, in 1952, where it has since been displayed.[5][1]
 In 2016, the heir of the Leffmanns sued the Metropolitan Museum of Art in U.S. federal court, seeking the return of the painting on the ground that the Leffmans had sold it under duress.[5] In 2018, Judge Loretta A. Preska of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of the Met, ruling that the plaintiff could not show, under New York law, that the painting was sold under duress. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal on the ground that the claim was raised too late (72 years after the work was sold and 58 years after it was donated to the art museum).[6]
 In 2010, experts estimated that the painting, which is one of the largest from Picasso's Rose Period, is worth more than US$100 million.[3]
 The Actor was damaged on January 25, 2010, when a woman attending an art class at The Metropolitan Museum of Art stumbled and fell into the painting, creating a rip of about 15 centimetres (5.9 in) in height in the lower right corner. The museum stated that the rip did not affect the artwork's central subject, and that they intended to have the painting repaired in a few weeks by performing ""unobtrusive"" work. This was in preparation for an April 27 retrospective of roughly 250 of the artist's works.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Madonna,Davis Madonna,"The Davis Madonna is a tempera on panel painting by Gentile da Fabriano, created c. 1410. It is held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York. The painting is named after Theodore M. Davis who acquired it in Florence, early in the 20th century before leaving it to its present owner in 1915.[1]
 The painting is in a bad state of conservation, that is still improved nowadays, thanks to the restoration work. The Virgin Mary is seen seated on a slender throne pierced with arches and Gothic decorations, which is reminiscent of the Venetian tradition (both architectural and goldsmith's), from which dense foliage of shrubs sprout. She looks to the right, while the Child blesses on the left, suggesting that some side compartments were once also present.
It is a variant on the artist's Perugia Madonna, painted just before it. The 'plant throne' merges the iconography of the Maestà's throne with the Madonna of Humility sat on the earth, due also to the similarity between the Latin words humus (""meadow"") and humilitas (""humility""). At the base there are small musical angels and a scroll bearing the Regina caeli, an Easter antiphon that reads: ""[R]egina c[o]eli l[a] eta re alleluia [quia] quem meruist [i] por tar[e a]ll[e]luya [r]esur [rexit] / sicut"".[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Interiors,Dutch Interiors,"The Dutch interiors are a series of three paintings painted by Joan Miró in 1928, each inspired by Dutch Golden Age paintings of Dutch interiors. Dutch Interior I is a reinterpretation of the Lute Player by Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh, Dutch Interior II is a reinterpretation of Children Teaching a Cat to Dance by Jan Steen, and Dutch Interior III is a reinterpretation of the Young woman at her toilet, also by Steen. They belong to a period of Miró which is called ""assassination of painting"".
In the spring of 1928, during a trip to Belgium and Holland, Miró was impressed by the Dutch masters of the 17th century. After buying colorful postcards of some paintings he began his reinterpretations. The colors are the hues of the original paintings, but the intensity of the color is purely Miró. Thus, a green-gray gradient wall of Martensz Sorgh becomes a green apple in Miró.
 This painting presents a scene where the lute player stands in the centre. A woman besides him looks at the partiture, near a table. Under the table, a cat and a dog are playing. These domestic components contrast with the landscape of Amsterdam which is seen through a window.
 It includes the same degree of detail shown in The Farm, with nowaday objects[1] as the basket of the house. The huge size of the main elements, as the lute, corresponds to its importance in the scene and not to its real size or the proportions of the original picture. This ability to break the model by distorting the images (mainly sizes and shapes of the objects) is a key characteristic of Miró's style.[2] It doesn't go never very far away from the Flemish model. As Miró reported ""I had the postcard pinned up on my easel while I painted""[3]
 The colours belong to the same hue as in the original painting but with a greater intensity. They are pure and flat colours, not mixed ones, with special attention to green, white and brown.
 In this painting there are some repeated elements, like the dog and the cat, who dance with a group of children. The subject is not a description or a realistic work, but the music and the sound. Two red eyes are watching the scene and they foresee the fantasy touch of the third one, so the three paintings can be seen as a progressive series. Blue and brown are the main colours of the interior, while the cat serves as the spinning force of the whole composition.
 It shows the aim of Miró to perform what it was called antipainting, influenced by Dada and Marcel Duchamp. When he takes a famous painting and transforms it, he is recognizing his debt with the model while he destroys it.[4] At the same time Miró is questioning his own previous work.
 The third painting of the series differs from the other two because, despite being inspired by a domestic scene of a Flemish model, it changes the subject: the main character is a woman who isn't taking a bath but giving birth to a goat. This woman is impaled by a nail to the floor and is framed by a black line, one of the typical colours of Miró.[5] The cruelty of the scene is softened by the stylization of the details,[6] although the red of the blood makes it harder, attracting the attention of the viewer.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_State_Entering_New_York_Harbor,The Golden State Entering New York Harbor,"The Golden State Entering New York Harbor is an 1854 painting (oil on canvass, 26"" x 48' or 66 cm x 121.9 cm) of an American three-masted clipper merchant ship by Fitz Henry Lane (1804-1865). Lane was an American lithographer and a maritime painter who lived most his life in the New England fishing city of Gloucester, Massachusetts, north of Boston, Massachusetts, on Cape Ann. The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[1]
 Although Lane spent much of his life in Massachusetts, he had a strong incentive during the early 1850s to spend time in New York City, a busy seaport full of activity for a maritime artist. First, Lane's work was being sold through exhibitions at New York galleries. Second, Lane was hired by Chambers & Heiser, a New York merchant shipping line, to paint the company's new vessel, the Golden State.[2] The ship, built for travel to California – during the California Gold Rush – around Cape Horn during a period when transcontinental land crossings across North America were not reliable, was launched in 1853, the same year that Westervelt was elected Mayor of New York City.
 For Lane, the work in 1854 on The Golden State Entering New York Harbor was a repeat commission. Chambers & Heiser had brought him to New York during the previous year to paint the company's clipper ship Sweepstakes.
 The Golden State Entering New York Harbor was commissioned by the owner of Golden State, Lane’s second for Chambers & Heiser. It is rich in detail, depicting New York City in the background, as seen from New Jersey. A steamship is shown just past the bow of the Golden State. A variety of vessels plies New York Harbor. [3]
 Four stylistic characteristics are seen in The Golden State Entering New York Harbor.
 First, Golden State evidences the luminism style of American landscape painting in the 1850s through the 1870s. Luminism uses careful attention to light in landscapes, aerial perspective, and concealment of visible brushstrokes to emphasize tranquility. Water is often calm and reflective; the sky is often soft and hazy. The Hudson River School typifies luminicsm in art.[4]
 Second, Golden State shows strong influence onto Lane's work from Robert Salmon (1775-1845), an English artist who lived in Boston and was the preeminent marine painter of his time. His studio was near Lane's lithography shop in Boston, where Lane lived during his early adult years. The Fitz Henry Lane Online Project notes, ""[W]e have no direct evidence of contact or a teacher-student relationship. Lane's early works are so indebted to Salmon they have been confused with his in the past. In this case [i.e., Golden State], the wind-whipped waves diagonally patterned across the canvass are very much like Salmon's style, as are the light-and-dark patterns of the cloud and a tumultuous harbor scene crowded with vessels.""
 Third, Golden State shows a turn by Lane from landscapes and shoreline structures to maritime activity. Lane's commissions in New York City from Chambers & Heiser led to larger and more detailed, busier paintings. Additionally, Lane had established a market for his art in Boston; he wanted his New York exhibitions to add to his business success.
 Fourth, Golden State as well as Sweepstakes are the only two known paintings of Lane in which he signed his full name. On Golden State, the signature reads: ""Fitz Henry Lane, Gloucester, Mass. A.D. 1854."" The Fitz Henry Lane Online Project speculates that Lane wanted his new clients in New York City to remember all his painting details.[3]

Also known as the Fesch Altarpiece or the Eckinson Altarpiece, it is now divided up between a number of galleries in the United States and Europe.[1]
 The work probably originated in or near Fermo, in the Marche, where the artist was active for a number of years. In 1834 Amico Ricci wrote of a ""Madonna with saints"" by Crivelli from the church of San Domenico in Fermo which had been sold a few years earlier. It is stylistically close to the artist's Massa Fermana Altarpiece. It had five panels on the main register, topped by a Pietà which may have been flanked by four now-lost unidentified half-length saints.[2]
 An early reconstruction of the work was produced in 1933 by Venturi and this was improved in 1958 by Bernard Berenson and in 1961 by Federico Zeri:[3]

 The Baker's Cart was painted in 1656 by relatively obscure French painter Jean Michelin.[1] Michelin's claim to significance were his depictions of peasants in urban settings, as opposed to more common pastoral ones; this is reflected in The Baker's Cart, which is set in the city. The painting depicts a family of peasants peddling wares from their cart. Large slabs of bread can be seen for sale, as can a vial of eau-de-vie, a medicinal brandy-based solution. The family themselves are visibly poor, as indicated by their clothing, complexions and profession.[1]
 It was not known that Michelin painted the work until his signature was uncovered on the painting's frame in 1920s.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By_the_Seashore,By the Seashore,"By the Seashore is a painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir completed in 1883 and is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.[1]
 Renoir made a trip to Italy in 1881-82 and was deeply influenced by Renaissance art. After this trip he began to explore a new manner of painting, different from impressionism. He started to emphasize contours and modeling, abandoned the principle that scenes should be painted outdoors to capture light and atmosphere.[2]
 Late in the summer of 1883, Renoir spent about a month in St. Peter Port, the capital of Guernsey, and admired the rocks, cliffs and stunning view of Moulin Huet Bay in St. Martin. He painted the starts of fifteen pictures during his stay, most of which were finished later in his Paris studio. Guernsey lies 48 km off the coast of mainland Normandy. Both share the same geology and Guernsey fulfills the ""by the sea"" criterion in the exhibition title.[3]
 However, By the Seashore is thought to have been painted in the artist's studio.[1] The beach depicted here is probably not in the Channel Islands but near Dieppe, on the Normandy coast. The model was Aline Charigot, his then girlfriend, whom he married in 1890.[2] The arc of the sitter's dark eyebrows and saucily tilted nose in that pleasant, rosy-cheeked face are common to works by Renoir.
 By the Seashore proto-typically reflects this period in Renoir's art. He worked with small compositions in the field that he then pulled together in more elaborate, larger works while in his studio. He was also playing with the disparity of space and scale between figure and background at this time. [3]
 The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan since 1929 from the bequest of Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer.[4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca%27_Dolfin_Tiepolos,Ca' Dolfin Tiepolos,"The Ca' Dolfin Tiepolos are a series of ten oil paintings made c.1726–1729 by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo for the main reception room or salone of the Palazzo Ca' Dolfin [de], the palazzo of the patrician Dolfin family (sometimes spelled Delfini, Delfino, or Delfin) in Venice.  The paintings are theatrical depictions of events from the history of Ancient Rome, with a typically Venetian emphasis on drama and impact rather than historical accuracy.  They were painted on shaped canvases and set into the architecture with frescoed surrounds. 
 The Tarantine Triumph was the first work completed, depicting the triumph awarded to Manius Curius Dentatus after defeating Pyrrhus of Epirus in the Battle of Beneventum, the last battle of the Pyrrhic War in 275 BC, at which captured elephants were first seen in Rome.  The Triumph of Marius was the last completed, depicting the triumph awarded to Gaius Marius after defeating Jugurtha of Numidia in the Jugurthine War: it is dated 1729, and includes a self-portrait of Tiepolo on the left.  The differences in style and composition between the works demonstrate Tiepolio's rapid development as a painter.
 The series was quickly recognised as a masterpiece, and its success drove forward Tiepolo's career.  He decorated buildings across Venice and the Veneto in the following decades.  The paintings remained in Venice until sold in 1872, and are now held in three museums, with two held by the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, three by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and five by the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.
 Tiepolo was born in 1696.  While still a young man in his 20s, he was commissioned by Dionisio Dolfin [it], the Patriarch of Aquileia, to decorate the Cappella del Santissimo Sacramento in Udine Cathedral (completed 1726) and then to paint a two cycles of Old Testament paintings for the Patriarchal Palace [it] (or arcivescovado) in Udine (completed 1726–1728), including Rachel hiding Laban's idols [es; it] and Sarah and the archangels [es].  The paintings from the Patriarchal Palace are now displayed in Udine's Museo diocesano e gallerie del Tiepolo [it].
 Still only in his early 30s, Tiepolo was then commissioned by Dionisio's brother Daniele [it] to paint a series of ten painting depicting scenes from Ancient Rome for a large reception room on the piano nobile at the family's house in Venice, the Ca' Dolfin building, on the north side of the Rio di Ca' Foscari [fr] just off the Grand Canal.  The building had been constructed by the Secco family, and acquired by Cardinal Giovanni Dolfin in 1621.  Before Tiepolo began work, the room had already been partially decorated with trompe-l'œil wall paintings by Antonio Felice Ferrari c.1708 and ceiling frescos by Niccolò Bambini c.1714.  Gaps in the walls had been left, filled with blank canvases to be painted in oils later: the combination of fresco and oil painting is unusual, but allows artists to switch between mediums according to the season.
 The paintings are reconstructions of historical scenes from Ancient Rome.  In several cases, the identification of the intended subjects are not certain, but they appear to be an account of the expansion of the Roman Empire, from the (possibly legendary) event when Scaevloa thrust his hand into the sacrificial fire before Lars Porsena c.509 BC and the deaths of Lucius Junius Brutus and Arruns Tarquinius (son of Tarquin the Proud) at the Battle of Silva Arsia in 509 BC, through the wars against the Latin tribes of Italy, including Gaius Marcius Coriolanus and Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus fighting against the Volsci, Corioli and Aequi in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the victory of Manius Curius Dentatus over Pyrrhus of Epirus near Taranto in 275 BC, the Second Punic War at the end of the 3rd century including Quintus Fabius Maximus, Hannibal, and the capture of Carthage, to the victory of Gaius Marius over the Cimbri at the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC.  It is possible that the victory of the Romans over Carthage was intended as an allegory for the victory of the Republic of Venice over the Ottoman Empire.
 The irregular profiles of the canvases were determined by the architectural features into which they were inserted.  The 11 by 17 metres (36 ft × 56 ft) room in Venice has survived, with the recesses now filled with mirrors, so shape of the canvases allows a reconstruction of the original arrangement of the paintings in the room.
 On the long walls to either side of the main door on the north side were two battle scenes, each measuring approximately 410 by 380 centimetres (160 in × 150 in), and usually identified as The Capture of Carthage and The Battle of Vercellae (both at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York).  (Alternatively, they may represent battles of Coriolanus against the Volsci and Corioli.)  The opposite long wall has five arched windows overlooking the canal to the south.  Two narrower canvases, each approximately 380 by 180 centimetres (150 in × 71 in), were placed to either side of the central window, depicting The Death of Lucius Junius Brutus and Arruns Tarquinius, and Hannibal Contemplating the Head of Hasdrubal (both at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna).  
 There were three paintings on the shorter walls to either side, with one large central painting flanked by two smaller ones.  The paintings on the west wall, lit from the windows to the south, were The Triumph of Marius (also in New York) flanked by Quintus Fabius Maximus before the Senate of Carthage and Cincinnatus Offered the Dictatorship, and on the east wall opposite were The Tarantine Triumph flanked by  Mucius Scaevola before Porsenna and Veturia Pleading with Coriolanus (all five at the Hermitage in St Petersburg).  The tall central scenes measure approximately 550 by 320 centimetres (220 in × 130 in), and each of the four flaking scenes is approximately 390 by 230 centimetres (154 in × 91 in).
 Apart from the two battle scenes, the other eight canvases had banderoles explaining the subject, with Latin text taken from the Epitome of Roman History (""Epitome de T. Livio Bellorum omnium annorum DCC Libri duo""), an early 2nd century commentary attributed to Lucius Annaeus Florus on the 1st century AD History of Rome of Livy.  The banderoles were painted over after the paintings were removed, but some have been restored later.  The shapes of the canvases were also altered when they were removed from their original location in 1872, with additional areas added to square them off, but those in New York and Vienna have been restored to their original shapes.
 Tiepolo adopted a less retrained palette for these paintings than his earlier works, with elements of the Baroque or even the Rococo.  
 The paintings were quickly recognised as a masterpiece, praised by Vincenzo da Canal in 1732 as among Teipolo's best, and by Jean-Honoré Fragonard in 1761 as among his most beautiful works in Venice.  They remained in situ for over 200 years while the building was inherited by increasingly distant descendants of the Dolfin family, but the building was largely abandoned by 1870.  The Palazzo Ca' Dolfin was acquired by the Ca' Foscari University of Venice in 1955, based at the Ca' Foscari nearby; restored, it is used as a guesthouse by the university, with the salone becoming the ""Aula Magna"", a great hall for events.   
 To pay a tax bill, a family descendant sold the paintings in 1872 via the art dealer Moses Michelangelo Guggenheim to the Austrian collector Baron Eugen Miller von Aichholz [de] for 50,000 livres.  The Baron had nowhere to display them: within a few years, he put them on sale again in Paris, and five were acquired by Alexander Polovtsov (sometimes spelled Polovzeff).  In 1886, Polovtsov presented them to the Central School of Technical Drawing, which had been founded in St Petersburg by his father-in-law Alexander von Stieglitz.  These five paintings have been held by the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg since 1934."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_for_the_Carnival,Dressing for the Carnival,"Dressing for the Carnival is an 1877 painting by the American painter, printmaker and illustrator Winslow Homer.
 Homer painted African Americans, completely avoiding the stereotypes with which their collective image had been flooded during the period of Reconstruction after the American Civil War. The 1870s and 1880s produced innumerable images of African Americans at carnival time, mindless, jolly, condescending.
But Homer's Dressing for the Carnival is unlike all of them: a deeply nuanced and, in the end, tragic scene of preparation for festivity. A group of people is preparing for the African-American festival known in the South as Jonkonnu and in the North as Pinkster. It entailed the costuming of a Harlequin-like figure or Lord of Misrule, and this Homer depicts: a man caparisoned in bright, tatterdemalion clothes, yellow, red, and blue, with a liberty cap on his head. Two women are sewing them on him. The one on the right extends her arm, pulling the long thread right through, in a gesture of compelling and somber gravity; she is a classical Fate, seen below the Mason-Dixon line. Next to her, but apart from her, gazing at the vesting ceremony with wonder, are some children, one of whom holds a Stars and Stripes (for by Reconstruction, the rituals of the Fourth of July had been overlaid on those of Jonkonnu). Homer makes us sense how far the hopes of emancipation still are from the realities of black life in the South.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1476_Altarpiece,1476 Altarpiece,"The 1476 Altarpiece or San Domenico Altarpiece is a 1476 tempera and gold on panel altarpiece by Carlo Crivelli. Its central panel of the Pietà is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, whilst the other nine are now in the National Gallery, London.
 The altarpiece was likely originally constructed for the Dominican church of Ascoli Piceno, given the inclusion of Dominican saints on the lower levels of the altarpiece. The church held another 1476 Crivelli work, the Saint Peter Martyr Altarpiece. Both works were dismantled from their altars c. 1776 due to renovations in the church. They were then sold to an antiquarian, Grossi, who further separated the panels and regrouped them. (The predellas that went with the altarpieces are lost.)
 The altarpiece was seen by Luigi Lanzi and purchased by Francesco Saverio de Zelada in Rome in 1789, and it arrived in Florence with the Rinuccini family [it]. The 1476 Altarpiece arrived at London's National Gallery in 1868, having come from the Demidov collection. 
 Art historians Federico Zeri and Rodolfo Pallucchini [it] reintegrated the formerly separated altarpieces, referring first to the Pietà in the Metropolitan Museum and second to the Madonna in the Museum of Fine Arts of Budapest. In 1961, the National Gallery again disjoined its panels and reconstructed them into two separate polyptychs.
 The altarpiece has a traditional setting, with a Madonna Enthroned with Child at the center, the saints depicted to the sides, and on the upper level a Pietà and half-figure saints.
 The structure of the altarpiece perplexed critics for a long time. Art historians eventually adopted the theory that the altarpiece was actually an assemblage of panels from different sources.

 Cuyp mainly painted landscapes, but these often included anonymous riders in compositions similar to this.  By contrast, few of his paintings are portraits.  This portrait is an early example of an equestrian portrait of someone who was not a member of court; previously, equestrian portraits had been restricted to only the high nobility and royalty, but in this period in the Netherlands, this was changing, and Cuyp and his father, Jacob Gerritszoon Cuyp, led this change, with the encouragement of Cornelis van Beveren.[1][2]
 The painting shows two young men, brothers Cornelis Pompe van Meerdervoort (left) and Michiel Pompe van Meerdervoort, with their tutor, Caulier, their coachman, Willem, and dogs. In the background of the image, there is a ruined castle, likely intended to indicate the ancient lineage of those pictured. The castle does not look like the Huis te Meerdervoort, the family home of the Pompe van Meerdervoort, located across the Oude Maas from Dordrecht and to the south of Zwijndrecht. The castle was originally painted in the left middleground, before it was repainted on the right. In the left of the background, sailboats can be seen on the river Rhine and the churches and associated buildings of Hoog-Elten, Rindern, and Laag-Elten.[1][2][3][4]
 The background is believed to have been sourced from Cuyp's Drawing of Rhine near Elten. Despite this background, there is no known connection between the Pompe van Meerdervoort family and that region. However, a 1994 guide to the Met notes that the landscape near Elten is similar to that of Dordrecht.[1][2][3][4]
 The dogs are believed to be greyhounds and foxhounds, while the animal on the left of the painting is thought to be a hare. The clothing worn by those pictured would not have been common in the Netherlands and has been described as both Hungarian and Persian. The two boys and their riding instructor are wearing tight-fitting coats, known as dolmans, while the coachman is wearing a looser and heavier coat, known as a mente. The cap worn by Cornelis is similar to a Turkish turban. It has been observed that the heads of the figures are awkwardly painted and this had been attributed to Cuyp's primary focus on landscape painting. The hand gesture of Caulier was originally simply a direction, but would later have been viewed as an indication of who would quickly become the sole heir of the close family.[1][2][4]
 It is most likely that the painting was commissioned by Adriana van Beveren, the widowed mother of the two young men, who is known to have been the first owner of the painting. However, it is also possible that the painting was commissioned by their uncle, Matthijs van Slingelandt, or her father, Cornelis van Beveren. After the death of Adriana van Beveren, it passed to Cornelis Pompe van Meerdervoort. It then was passed down through the family with the Huis te Meerdervoort until 1806, when it was sold by Christina Elisabeth Pompe van Meerdervoort, the great granddaughter of Cornelis. It was sold on August 20, 1806 in The Hague as Hunting Party with Three Men on Horses and a Hunter with Dogs in Foreground for 695 Dutch guilders.
 On April 19–20, 1825, it was sold at the Galerie Lebrun in Paris as Le Partie de Chasse for 17,950 French francs. On May 1–2, 1829, it was sold in London as La Partie de Chasse du Prince d'Orange for £1,102.10. On June 17, 1848, it was sold at Christie's in London as Prince of Orange on a grey horse for £556.10. On May 9–10, 1895, it was again sold at Christie's as The Prince of Orange, with his sons, prepared to depart for the Chase for £2,100. On June 9, 1911, it was sold at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris as Départ pour la chasse for either 160,000 or 170,000 francs. On June 14, 1913, it was again sold at the Galerie Georges Petit for 145,000 francs. On June 23, 1922, it was sold for the final time at the Galerie Georges Petit for 62,000 francs to Michael Friedsam, who held it until his death, at which time it was bequeathed to the Met. Since being acquired by the Met, it has been exhibited in many other museums in the United States and the Netherlands, including the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Dordrechts Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.[1][2]

 Cider Making was painted by William Sidney Mount in either 1840 or 1841. The painting can be seen as a political work; Mount, a conservative democrat, was strongly opposed to the presidency of Andrew Jackson and his successor Martin Van Buren, whose political opponent William Henry Harrison often used rural imagery to criticize the former. Harrison's Whig Party was also commonly associated with cider makers.[1]

 In the early 1880s, Eakins, instructor in painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, began to photograph models dressed in classical garb or nude and posed in vaguely classical poses. He used his friends and students as models, although taking nude photographs of a student was contrary to PAFA policy.[2] Some of the photographs were used as studies for subsequent works, including those of nude young men swimming and relaxing on the shore of Dove Lake for the painting The Swimming Hole (1884-85).
 Eakins's models for Arcadia were his former student and soon-to-be wife, Susan Macdowell, his teaching assistant at PAFA, J. Laurie Wallace, and his six-year-old nephew Ben Crowell (son of his sister Fanny). He photographed them outdoors in a number of poses and used the photographs as studies for Arcadia and several related works.[3] The Arcadian works were very personal to Eakins—he even had himself photographed as the piper.[4]

Done in watercolor, gouache, and graphite on wove paper, the work depicts Tucupit Point (formerly Colburn's Butte) in the Kolob Canyons, Zion National Park. 
 Colburn's Butte was rendered by Moran after the artist viewed the Kolob Canyons on a trip from Salt Lake City to the north rim of the Grand Canyon. At the time, Moran was travelling to join an expedition of John Wesley Powell along the Colorado river.[1] Moran's party passed a then unnamed pinnacle in July, with Moran choosing to render a watercolor drawing of the geographic feature. He would later give the watercolor to Justin Colburn, a correspondent for the New York Times travelling with Moran, for whom ""Colburn's Butte"" would later be named. Moran later made an engraving (heavily based on his watercolor) of the butte and published it in The Aldine.[2]
 In the watercolor, several peaks can be seen; the titular Colburn's Butte can be identified as the second from left peak with a white cloud behind it.[2] Colburn's Butte would later be renamed Tucupit Point, and the landmark now falls within the borders of Zion National Park.[2]
 The watercolor was donated to the Met in 2009.[a][2]
