The unique appeal of the portrait lies in its enigmatic nature, Mona Lisa’s smile radiates mystery, sensuality and contentment. This was achieved through sfumato, Leonardo’s painting technique that softened the transition between colors. This depth and complexity of expression is the reason the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] is regarded as the pinnacle of portraiture. The interest in the portrait was further amplified by its mysterious history: the identity of the sitter, who commissioned the painting, how long Leonardo worked on the portrait and how it entered the French royal collection are all topics of scholarly debate. 

It is thought that the sitter was Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo. For this reason, the painting is sometimes called [i]La Gioconda[/i]. The earliest identification of the painting was provided by the Renaissance art historian [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url]. In Vasari’s 1550 biography of Leonardo, he wrote about the magnificent portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, which Leonardo worked on between 1503 and 1506. Many were skeptical of Vasari’s account; however, a 2005 discovery at the University of Heidelberg provided compelling new evidence that confirms Vasari’s assertion. In a volume written by the ancient philosopher Cicero from 1477, there was a handwritten marginal by Leonardo’s contemporary, the secretary and assistant to Niccolò Machiavelli, Agostino Vespucci. In the note dated October 1503, Vespucci praises Leonardo’s skill by comparing him to the Greek and painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], and states that Leonardo is working on a portrait of Lisa del Giacondo.

The [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was the earliest example in Italian portraiture that portrayed the sitter in a half-length format. Leonardo presented a new artistic formula: the figure is shown at half-length sitting in armchair in front of a [i]loggia[/i] - a gallery or room with one or more open sides. The incorporation of the [i]loggia[/i] allowed Leonardo to present an imaginary landscape as the backdrop of the portrait. This significant innovation influenced Leonardo contemporaries: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] adopted the composition and pose in his portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-a-lady-with-a-unicorn-1506][i]Young Woman with Unicorn[/i][/url] (ca. 1506). Still it is important to note that Leonardo was indebted to Flemish portraiture of the second half of the 15th century, particularly the portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling]Hans Memling[/url] such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/barbara-de-vlaenderberch-1475][i]Portrait of Barbara van Vlaendenbergh[/i][/url] (ca. 1470-1472) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/portrait-of-a-man-holding-a-coin-of-the-emperor-nero-1474][i]Man with a Roman coin[/i][/url] (ca. 1480).

Leonardo spent his final years in France, where his patron the King of France, Francis I, purchased [i]Mona Lisa[/i] for the royal French collection. From 1797, the portrait is on permanent display at the Louvre and is the crown jewel of the museum collection. On the morning of August 22 1911, Louvre employees were shocked to discover that the painting was stolen the previous night. Two years later, Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia was identified as the thief. Peruggia claimed his motives were patriotic: he believed Leonardo’s masterpiece belonged in Italy and was caught trying to sell the painting in Florence. After its discovery, the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was exhibited throughout Italy before its celebratory return to the Louvre in 1914.",816,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/00475/images/leonardo-da-vinci/0000136308-og.JPG!HD.JPG,1200

It is also a commercial icon and a line mark of European Art.

The real subject of the painting and its meaning is a mystery under discussion. Over the centuries, many theories and interpretations have been developed, proving the complexity of this work of art. The composition of the painting is quite simple: in the center, there’s a figure of Venus, goddess of love, standing in a shell being washed up on a beach, blown there by two personifications of winds visible on the left, and welcomed by a maiden on the right. There is a contrast between the title of the work and what it represents: we do not see the moment of Venus’ birth. According to the myth, she was born from the foam of the sea, but the painting shows us the moment when she arrives on land. It is clear that the personifications of the winds are Zephyrus and Aura, one impetuous and the other moderate. But the figure of the girl is uncertain: she could be Spring, a subject dear to Botticelli, because her dress is full of flowers, or the personification of motherhood, or one of the Three Graces. She has branches of roses around her waist, and myrtle branches around her neck - sacred plants for Venus.

The painting is a masterpiece of linearity and harmonious design, clarity, and brightness of colors, which includes the use of gold in a lot of detail. We have to remember that the painting today is not as glorious it was initially. The colors were brighter, especially the greens of the trees, and the blue of the sky.

[i]The Birth of Venus[/i] is a work of extraordinary innovation, from many points of view. First, it is a representation of a nude woman: this kind of subject was restricted during the Medieval ages - the only exception was an image of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Botticielli produced the image of a beautiful naked woman, with a gaze that is remarkably in direct engagement with the viewer. Next, there is the news of the mythological theme that in the 1480s was absolutely a new type of painting. Botticelli obviously read classical texts before painting it: for example, the Roman writer Plinio made the description of the painting by the Greek artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url] that showed Venus rising from the sea or a Homeric hymn that told about Zephyrus that blows his wind on Aphrodite. 

But not only the classical world was the source of Botticelli's work. He depicted the scene with a solemnity that recalls a religious rite; the disposition of the characters and their gestures remind representations of the Baptism of Christ, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrocchio/the-baptism-of-christ]that of Verrocchio[/url], which Botticelli had certainly seen. This iconographic analogy alludes, perhaps, to a thematic analogy between the mythical birth of the goddess from the sea and the Christian birth of the soul from the water of Baptism.

It is highly probable that the work was commissioned by a member of the Medici family (perhaps by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, a major patron of Botticelli, under the influence of his cousin Lorenzo de' Medici, ""il Magnifico""), although there is nothing written about the painting before 1550, when [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url] describes it in the Medici’s Villa of Castello, owned by the cadet branch of the Medici family since the mid-15th century. This hypothesis would seem to be born out by the orange trees in the painting, which are considered an emblem of the Medici dynasty, on account of the assonance between the family name and the name of the orange tree, which at the time was ‘[i]mala medica[/i]’.",1600,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/sandro-botticelli/the-birth-of-venus-1485(1).jpg,1067

With its expressive colours, its flowing lines and striking overall effect, its appeal is universal.

Despite radical simplification, the landscape in the picture is recognisable as the Kristiania Fjord seen from Ekeberg, with a broad view over the fjord, the town and the hills beyond. In the background to the left, at the end of the path with the balustrade that cuts diagonally across the picture, we see two strolling figures, often regarded as two friends whom Munch mentions in notes relating to the picture. But the figure in the foreground is the first to capture the viewer’s attention. Its hands are held to its head and its mouth is wide open in a silent scream, which is amplified by the undulating movement running through the surrounding landscape. The figure is ambiguous and it is hard to say whether it is a man or a woman, young or old – or even if it is human at all.

As with many of Munch’s pictures, it is assumed that here as well his starting point was private feelings and experience. His diaries contain several remarks that seem to form a background to this depiction of existential angst, among them the following: “I was walking along the road with two friends – Then the sun went down – The sky suddenly turned to blood and I felt a great scream in nature –”.

The Scream was first exhibited at Munch’s solo exhibition in Berlin in 1893. It was a central element in “The Frieze of Life”, and has been the theme of probing analysis and many suggested interpretations. The painting also exists in a later version, which is in the possession of the Munch Museum. In addition Munch worked with the motif in drawings, pastels and prints.

It became one of Mucha's most popular designs; at least nine variants of this lithograph are known, including this one which was printed without text to serve as a decorative panel.",654,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00380/images/alphonse-mucha/mucha-zodiac-portfolio-arts-group.jpg,900

Whereas some believe that the middle panel, which depicts a fantastical world of nudes in sexual engagement, large fruits, and other suggestive elements, is simply an illustration of paradise lost, others believe that it is a moral warning, which will lead you to hell, as it is depicted in the third panel of the series. Although there are many contradictory explanations, it is generally thought to be a warning against lust, one of the seven deadly sins.

Adele Bloch-Bauer was the only person to be painted twice by Klimt. This painting is perhaps most famous not for its artistic quality, but because of its scandalous history since inception. Upon her death, Adele Bloch-Bauer wished the painting to be given to the Austrian State Gallery, but it was seized by advancing German forces in World War II. In 1945, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer designated the paintings to be the property of his nephew and nieces, including Maria Altmann. Nonetheless, the Austrian government retained ownership of the painting, and was not returned to the Altmann family until 2006 after a long court battle. The painting was then sold at auction for $135 million dollars, which at that time was the highest price paid at auction for a painting. It is now displayed the Neue Art Gallery in New York.

The subtle shading evokes a host of textures exuding softness, warmth, and the absence of immediate tension. The robe has slipped off the sitter's shoulder, exposing her right breast. Coupled with the absent stare of the woman and the dog, the muted colors and faint contours give this composition an overall flatness.

The sitter is Kitty Garman, Freud's first wife, and a noted beauty whose father was artist Jacob Epstein. The dog was one of two bull terriers they were given as a wedding gift.

Freud painted many portraits of Kitty during their brief marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952, due to his chronic infidelities. A weariness in the sitter's expression, the deep hollows under her eyes and the self-supporting gesture of the hand under the left breast hint at her discontent, despite this moment of calm. The analytic distance that came to characterize Freud's brilliance as an observer is reinforced by the absence of a name in the title, despite his intimate connection to the subjects.

As a method of self-promotion and advertisement, Courbet made an impression with his self-portraits, and used them to find his own artistic style. After this period, Courbet became convinced that painters should illustrate the world around them as they see it and his realistic work in the later 1840’s gained support among younger realist and neo-romantic painters.

His early submissions to the Salon reveal this fierce desire to succeed. After his ambitious Equality before Death (1849), the young man aimed to create an impression once again. He put forward an even larger painting inspired by Dante whose work was much loved by the Romantics and who captured all its dramatic beauty. This painting was inspired by a short scene from the Inferno, set in the eighth circle of Hell (the circle for falsifiers and counterfeiters), where Dante, accompanied by Virgil, watches a fight between two damned souls: Capocchio, a heretic and alchemist is attacked and bitten on the neck by Gianni Schicchi who had usurped the identity of a dead man in order to fraudulently claim his inheritance.

The critic and poet Théophile Gautier was very complimentary: ""Gianni Schicchi throws himself at Capocchio, his rival, with a strange fury, and Monsieur Bouguereau depicts magnificently through muscles, nerves, tendons and teeth, the struggle between the two combatants. There is bitterness and strength in this canvas – strength, a rare quality!” In fact, Bouguereau here shows great boldness. He is exploring the aesthetic boundaries: exaggerating the muscle structure to the point of distorting it, exaggerating the poses, contrasting colour and shadows, depicting monstrous figures and groups of damned souls. We are particularly reminded of the sublime visions of Romantic artists like Blake (1757-1827), Füssli (1741-1825), and Lawrence (1769-1830). Everything in this painting underlines the feeling of terribilita and horror: a theme to which Bouguereau would never again return.",957,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00142/images/57726d86edc2cb3880b49101/william-bouguereau-dante-and-virgile-google-art-project-2.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

For this reason, the members of the Arte del Cambio, the guild of which Gaspare di Zanobi was a part, used to invest great wealth in the creation of funerary monuments, making generous donations to the churches that accepted to host remains of them and their families. He wanted the chapel to be dedicated to the Epiphany, of which the Botticelli table was to be the main work of art. Above the table, Botticelli also painted the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/santa-maria-novella][i]Adoration of the Child[/i][/url] (1976), now detached and moved above the central portal of the Church, on the counter-façade.

The scene depicts the moment in which the three wise men, Magi, arrived at the birthplace of Jesus Christ. In the history of Florentine art, this scene was frequently painted. In Florence there never existed a real legitimate noble lineage, so every family that came to power commissioned to a painter an Adoration of the Magi and asked to portrait the members of the family as wise men bowed before Jesus, in order to show to the citizen that their government was blessed by God.

Botticelli fitted into this tradition, but he wanted to produce new, original work. He painted the usual subject: the Magi arriving at the manger. But, if in previous paintings the scene was depicted with the Kings arrived at the stable stately manger fitting for the Son of God,  the young Botticelli chose to place the scene in a dilapidated Roman ruin. At the center of this structure, he placed a sturdy rock for Mary and Jesus, to sit high above their visitors. With this decision, Botticelli seemed to say: Christianity will be built on sturdier materials than Rome.

The painter then populated the space with important men from his city. On the right side of the artworks, dressed in light blue, is the man who paid for it: Gaspare di Zanobi del Lama, looking out at the viewer and confidently pointing at himself, as to say that he gifted this beautiful piece of art to humanity. To paint the three Magi, appearing at the center of this painting, kneeling to Mary and Jesus, Botticelli took as models the members of the Medici family. This is a tribute wanted by the purchaser of the work: his wealth would not have been possible had he not been a courtier protected by Medici. In particular, by Cosimo de Medici, whom Botticelli painted prominently at Mary’s feet, in the act of bowing to kiss the Child's foot. The other Wise can be identified as Piero and Giovanni de Medici, Cosimo’s two sons. They are kneeling, speaking one each other. Finally, on the left in the painting, there is the portrait of the young Lorenzo il Magnifico, standing, with his hands entwined around the sword, who watches the scene as saying: today is your day, but I am the future.

Botticelli filled the rest of the space with other friends and influential figures from Florence, and among them, on the right, the confident young artist painted himself, looking directly at the viewer. His presence in this painting illustrates a radical shift in the perception of artists during this time period: Botticelli did not view himself as an ordinary craftsman hired for a simple job, he saw himself as a friend to the powerful families of Florence.

Mucha portrayed Bernardt as an exotic Byzantine noblewoman wearing a splendid gown and an orchid headdress with a palm branch in her hand. This costume was worn in the last act, the climax of the play, where she joined the Easter procession. Placing her life-size figure on an arched platform, Mucha rendered the beauty and dignity of her personality onstage rather than representing her realistic features or the story.

Because of this, he was attacked by critics, who pointed out that Vienna at the time was engaging in major medical advancements, and that the painting did not depict anything about either prevention or cure.

Those sent to hell for the sin of greed are boiled in pots of gold, and in the sin of pride a demon holds a mirror up to a prideful woman. The series of paintings is much more than a description of each sin and its punishment, as a whole it represents a warning to those who would engage in sin, and acts as a deterrent to evil doing.

The comparison to Leonardo Da Vinci’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/mona-lisa][i]Mona Lisa[/i][/url] (ca. 1504) makes sense: both paintings share an air of mystery, from the model’s enigmatic gaze to the speculations surrounding the identities of the women in the paintings. The identity of the model in [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] remains unknown. Some have suggested that it is Vermeer’s eldest daughter, Maria, however there is no compelling evidence to confirm this assertion.

The painting is considered a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/tronie#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]tronie[/url], a subcategory of portraiture that was popular in the Dutch Golden Age and Flemish [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Baroque[/url] art. Tronies are studies of facial characteristics, stereotypical characters or exaggerated expressions. Vermeer captures a fleeting moment, the girl turning her head, her lips slightly parted while she directly faces the viewer. The girl wears a head wrap inspired by a Turkish turban and an enormous pearl earring. These exotic elements increase the drama of the painting, and give the artist the opportunity to display artistic effects in his treatment of light and texture. Another tronie by Vermeer, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/study-of-a-young-woman][i]Study of A Young Woman[/i][/url] (ca. 1665-1667) is often seen as a variant or counterpart of [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i]. In both paintings, the figures are set against a black background, wearing the pearl earring and having a scarf draped over the shoulder. While [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] is an idealized beauty, the [i]Study of A Young Woman[/i] shows plain and imperfect facial features.

Even though [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] is consistent with Vermeer’s style and technique, it is distinct in a few noteworthy ways. Vermeer used his inventive method of layering paint that created the sensuality of the soft skin. This was accomplished by layering a thin flesh-colored glaze over a transparent under-modelling (the initial layers of color placed on the surface). Some have suggested that Vermeer was able to capture these details and effects through the use of [i]camera obscura[/i], an optical device that was able to project an image onto a flat surface. Vermeer employed this technique in other paintings, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/woman-holding-a-balance-1665][i]Woman Holding a Balance[/i][/url] (1665) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/young-woman-with-a-water-pitcher][i]Young Woman with a Water Pitcher[/i][/url] (ca. 1662-1665). In both cases, Vermeer used this technique of layering paint when creating the shaded portions of the headdress on the models.  However, in [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i], the application of paint is bolder and more expressive. In a 1994 restoration, it was discovered that Vermeer accentuated girl’s mouth with small dots of pink paint, and placed light accents in her eyes to brighten her face. The model is set against a dark background, which is very different than the detailed settings of Vermeer’s interior paintings, such as the mentioned [i]Woman Holding a Balance[/i] and [i]Young Woman with a Water Pitcher[/i]. In the interior settings, the women are portrayed in contemplative and quiet moments, while [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] has a sense of immediacy and drama. The painting has a timeless quality, the girl bears no symbolic attributes, and she is not placed in any specific context. For this reason, she has captured the imagination of viewers throughout generations.",759,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00380/images/johannes-vermeer/1-girl-with-a-pearl-earring-johannes-vermeer.jpg,900

The wall painting was commissioned by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, who was Leonardo’s patron during his first extended stay in Milan.

The composition of [i]The Last Supper[/i] is neatly arranged - Jesus is positioned in the center of a long table and the Apostles are to his left and right. The room is relatively plain: dark tapestries cover the walls on either side, while three windows on the back wall reveal a landscape that recalls the countryside of Milan. Leonardo created the illusion of space by using linear perspective – a technique in which all parallel lines in the painting converge in a single vanishing point. In [i]The Last Supper[/i], the single vanishing point, at Jesus’s right temple, draws the viewer’s attention to the main subject in the foreground. Jesus adorns the traditional blue and red robes, but he has no halo. Some scholars have suggested that Leonardo alludes to the halo through the shining light from the window behind Jesus, or the pediment above the window. Others however believed that the absence of the halo signifies the fact that Jesus is a still human being, who, as such, will suffer through the pain and death of the Passion.

In his depiction of [i]The Last Supper[/i], Leonardo chose to present the scene as a depiction of successive moments: Jesus has declared to the Apostles that one of them will betray him, and the Apostles react to his announcement. The serene expression and posture of Christ stands in contrast to the confused and agitated state of the Apostles. Their reactions and postures vary, adding interest and drama to the composition: on Christ’s left, James the Greater throws his arms out in anger, Thomas gestures to the sky as if to question God’s plan, and Phillip points towards himself wondering could he be the traitor. Some reactions hold additional symbolism: Peter holds a knife behind his back that he will later use to cut off an ear of a soldier attempting to arrest Christ. Judas, who is next to Peter, tightly grips the purse with the reward he received for betraying Jesus with one hand, while he reaches toward a dish with the other. Judas and Jesus reach for the same dish, a reference to the biblical quote: “[i]The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me[/i]” (Matthew 26:23).

When painting [i]The Last Supper[/i] Leonardo used an experimental technique, working with tempera and oil paint. The experimental technique combined with the humidity and the dampness of the location led to the quick deterioration of the painting. Over the centuries, the painting suffered additional damage. Due to its poor condition, the painting underwent a major restoration that began in 1978. The restoration, completed in 1999, proved controversial: many were dissatisfied with the outcome saying that hardly any of Leonardo’s original work is visible. Still, some praised the recovery of many details, like the food on the table and the facial expressions.",1920,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00178/images/leonardo-da-vinci/ltima-cena-da-vinci-5.jpg!HD.jpg,1082

The Queen is perhaps his most powerful and globally recognizable subject. While Freud normally worked large, this composition measures approximately nine and a half by six inches, making it one of his smallest paintings. Nonetheless, it depicts the British monarch as an imposing presence. The entire composition is filled by her face. A sliver of pearls adorns her throat, while atop her white hair is an elaborate, jeweled crown. The symmetrical details in the jewels and hair mark the parameters of the picture, and serve as a kind of psychic boundary for the work. The crown, an item Freud specifically requested she wear for the portrait, dominates the upper border of the picture.

After agreeing to pose for the artist, the Queen met Freud for a sitting in May of 2000. Making an exception from his usual practice of making a studio appointment, Freud traveled for sittings to St. James Palace at the Royal Collection's Friary Court, where she sat for him at the picture conservation studio. The small canvas took over six months to complete and was finally finished in December of 2001. By the time he was ready to paint the crown the Queen, who had other obligations, had run out of time. So a model had to be used. Freud, always a lightning rod for controversy, was accused of painting the Queen in an unflattering and unduly harsh light.

The project sparked debate and got mixed reviews (some saw it as a cheap publicity stunt by an artist with fading talent). Yet in his forthright observation of the Queen's features, one sees a raw intensity Freud had maintained throughout his career and refused to minimize, regardless of his subject. Among the more intriguing interpretations of this portrait, recently discussed by independent art historian Simon Abrahams, is that the Queen is a symbolic stand-in for the artist himself, a kind of alter-ego. The Queen's aging features in this portrait are remarkably similar to those of Freud himself, and the British press complained that the portrait looked nothing like her, adding credence to the theory.",683,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/lucian-freud/queen-elizabeth-ii-2001.jpg,1028

In the summer of that year, Manet stayed at his family's house in Gennevilliers, just across the Seine from Monet in Argenteuil. The Monet family was living in a house that Manet had helped them find the year before. This portrait of the Monet family—Camille Monet and Jean, with Claude Monet gardening at the left—is one of Manet's most significant essays in this new style. While Manet painted the Monet family, Renoir painted beside him and Monet worked nearby. Monet painted Manet at his easel (present location unknown), while Renoir, like Manet, painted Madame Monet, Jean Monet, and the rooster (http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/camille-monet-and-her-son-jean-in-the-garden-at-argenteuil-1874). In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: ""Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor painting of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy!

The painting has an enormous internal energy. The crossing diagonals forming the borders of the fields and the ploughed furrows, the contours of the roofs, the row of cypresses - such vectors strain the composition, but not so much as to disturb the unity of the whole.

He produced this politically charged work in support of the Red Army shortly after the Bolsheviks had waged their revolution in 1917. The red wedge symbolized the revolutionaries, who were penetrating the anti-Communist White Army. Here Lissitzky uses his signature coded color combination of red, white and black, which reinforces the message indicated by the work's title. Colors and shapes take on directly symbolic significance. For example, the smooth, curvilinear walls of the white circle are pierced by the sharp point of the red triangle: the Red Army has pierced the defenses of the White Army. Dramatic color contrasts also create confusion regarding space-which area is positive? Which is negative? Meanwhile, small geometric forms in the limited color scheme float like tiny projectiles through the space along with text. Here, basic forms combine with actual text: painting and typography are fused. This work is an important precursor to Lissitzky's Prouns, when Suprematist art moved onto a three-dimensional visual plain.",1129,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/el-lissitzky/beat-the-whites-with-the-red-wedge-1920.jpg,900

Her left hand rests on her cheek, and her gaze is fixed on a faraway place. In sharp contrast, a standing man is standing behind her and staring at her. His dark form looms over her menacingly, silhouetted against the sunlight. Other windows in the building across the street are visible in the background.

The man is Freud himself, and the woman is Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood, the Guinness ale heiress with whom he eloped in 1952 after the divorce from his first wife. At the time they were staying at the Hotel La Louisiane, and the work reflects the anxiety and tension in their relationship, which had already begun to unravel. She would soon leave him, and the distraught Freud, while having many more relationships, would never marry again. This painting is among the works that Freud exhibited it at the Venice Biennale when he was invited to serve as the representative of Britain in 1954, a great honor. Like this and other early portraits by the artist, the work has a flat, drawing-like quality. Here, however, the body of the artist is a black hole, threatening to suck the light out of the rest of the picture. The artist's standing pose also seems to predict a turning point in his working method. This is the last portrait he completed while sitting down. From that point on, he chose to stand while painting. One of his more narrative works, it exemplifies the autobiographical self-absorption and detachment associated with his later work.",802,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/lucian-freud/hotel-bedroom.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The painting refers to the biblical story of Jacob, who crossed the river Jabbok and spent the night wrestling a mysterious angel. The artist depicts the subject indirectly, showing a group of Breton women after a sermon in church. The women moved by the sermon see a vision of Jacob wrestling the angel.

The available information about the painting comes primarily from two sources: letters written by Gauguin and writings by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard]Emile Bernard[/url]. Bernard spent the summer of 1888 with Gauguin in Pont-Aven – the two worked side by side, and while Gauguin painted [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i] Bernard worked on the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard/breton-women-in-the-meadow-1888][i]Breton Women in the Meadow[/i][/url] (1888). The two paintings share stylistic similarities and are both examples of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cloisonnism]Cloisonnism[/url] – a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Both artists also shared an affinity for Japanese art, and Bernard wrote that the motif of [i]Jacob wrestling the angel in Vision After the Sermon[/i] was modeled after [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai]Hokusai[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/all-works#!#filterName:Theme_sumo-wrestlers,resultType:masonry]Sumo Wrestlers[/url].

Gauguin used the term [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/synthetism]Synthetism[/url] to describe paintings such as [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], in which he aimed to synthesize between the outward appearance of the subject, the artist’s emotional response to the subject, and the aesthetic considerations of line, form, and color. In [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], Gauguin creates a synthesis between two realities: the everyday life of the Breton women and their vision of the biblical event. In a letter to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url], he wrote about the sermon that inspired the painting: “For me, the landscape and the fight only exist in the imagination of the people praying after the sermon which is why there is a contrast between the life-size people and the struggle in its non-natural disproportionate landscape”. For this reason, Gauguin emphasized the contrast between the dramatic fight scene and the serenity of the women quietly praying.

By weaving together different Christian symbols, Gauguin added new content and meaning to the religious subject. In the foreground, he depicted twelve Breton women in prayer, a symbolic reference to Jacob’s twelve sons, the predecessors of the twelve tribes of Israel. The apple tree in the center of the composition was another non-traditional addition to the story of Jacob. In the bible, the apple tree is a symbol of knowledge, a reference to man’s awakening, and subsequently his fall from grace. In [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], the apple tree is full and lush, suggesting the possibility of man’s redemption and a possible return to paradise. Another important component is the bull emerging from the left corner of the painting. The bull is possibly a sacrificial animal, and as such, it can hint to the sacrifice of Christ and the chance for redemption. The bull is also connected to Breton, it is a symbol attributed to four Breton saints. In this way, Gauguin formed a connection between his unique symbolism and the spirituality of the devout Breton women.",1119,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/paul-gauguin/the-vision-after-the-sermon-jacob-wrestling-with-the-angel-1888.jpg,891

While some scholars doubted this identification, ample evidence affirms Cecilia Gallerani is the subject of [i]Lady with an ermine[/i]. The earliest mention of the portrait appears in a sonnet by court poet Bernardo Bellincioni, in which he notes that it seems as if Cecilia is listening to an unseen speaker. Further confirmation exists in a correspondence between Cecilia and Isabella d’Este, the marquise of Mantua. In her letter, the marquise asks Cecilia to send her the portrait so she can compare Leonardo’s work to that of another master, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini]Giovanni Bellini[/url]. Most importantly, the correspondence reveals that although Ludovico commissioned the painting, Cecilia owned it.

It is possible that because Cecilia was not of the highest rank, Leonardo allowed himself the freedom to break away from local conventions of portraiture. Most notably, he abandoned the local tradition of the profile portrait in favor of a three quarter view of the subject. Through the innovative pose Leonardo provoked the viewer’s curiosity and engaged them with the sitter of the portrait: she seems to be attentively gazing at something or someone out of view at the right side of the picture. The lady holds the ermine with her left hand, while her right hand elegantly caresses the animal’s shoulder. The suggestive hand gesture recurs in Leonardo’s later composition [i]Leda and the Swan[/i]  - even though the oil painting did not survive, the overall composition is known from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/leda-and-the-swan-1506]drawings[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/il-sodoma/leda-and-the-swan-copy-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1515]oil copies[/url] made after Leonardo’s painting. In [i]Lady with an ermine[/i], Leonardo also demonstrated tremendous skill in his treatment of contrasting textures: the smooth skin next to the ermine’s fur, the carved jet-black beads against the chest and the intricately woven dress, the embroidered garment besides the smooth plain silk.

One of the key elements of the painting is the lively creature Cecilia holds in her arms. In fact, the symbolism of the ermine provides further evidence supporting the identification of Cecilia as the sitter. The ermine is a symbol of moderation and purity, and as such, its inclusion is appropriate for a portrait of a mistress of a Renaissance duke. Scholars also pointed to the fact that the Greek word for ermine is [i]galé[/i], thus it is a play on the Cecelia’s surname (Gallerani). Additionally, some have suggested that the ermine is an emblem associated to Ludovico, thus the ermine can be interpreted as an allusion to Cecilia’s lover.

[i]Lady with an ermine[/i] was purchased in Italy around 1800 by the Polish Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. He brought the painting to Poland, where he presented it to his mother, the Princess Izabella. The painting was incorporated into the family collection in Puławy, the museum founded by Princess Izabella in 1796. Today, it is the highlight of the collection at the Czartoryski Museum in Kraków, and is considered one of Poland’s national treasures.",892,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00475/images/leonardo-da-vinci/dama-con-l-ermellino-1489-1491.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The first in 1596 and the other presumably in 1597/8. The first version also known as Murtula, due to the poet who wrote about it (48x55 cm) is signed Michel A F, (Michel Angelo Fecit) and was found on the painter’s studio only after his dead. Nowadays it belongs to a private collection whilst the second version, slightly bigger (60 x 55 cm) is not signed and it is in the Uffizi Gallery, in Florence. 
The “Head of Medusa” executed by Caravaggio, in 1598, was commissioned as a cerimonial shield by Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, the Medici family’s agent in Rome, after seeing, on the painters studio, the first version – The Metula painting. The purpose of this commissioned was to symbolize the Grand Duke of Tuscany's courage in defeating his enemies. For its subject matter, Caravaggio drew on the Greek myth of Medusa, a woman with snakes for hair who turned people to stone by looking at them. 
Medusa was a Gorgon monster, a terrifying female creature from the Greek Mythology. While descriptions of Gorgons vary across Greek literature, the term commonly refers to any of three sisters who had hair of living, venomous snakes, and a horrifying visage that turned those who beheld it to stone. Traditionally, while two of the Gorgons were immortal, Stheno and Euryale , their sister Medusa was not, and was slain by the mythical hero Perseus, the legendary founder of Mycenae and of the Perseid dynasty. According to the story, she was killed by Perseus, who avoided direct eye contact by using a mirrored shield. After Medusa’s death, her decapitated head continued to petrify those that looked at it. 
Caravaggio plays with this concept by modeling himself for Medusa’s face – making him the only one who is safe from Medusa’s dedly gaze – and having to look at his reflection to paint the shield in the same way that Medusa caught her own image moments before being killed. Although Caravaggio depicts Medusa’s severed head, she remains conscious. He heightens this combination of life and death through Medusa’s intense expression. Her wide-open mouth exudes a silent but dramatic scream and her shocked eyes and furrowed brow all suggest a sense of disbelief, as if she thought herself to be invincible until the moment. But Caravaggio’s Medusa does not have the full effect of scaring the viewer, since she does not look at us, thereby transferring the power of the gaze to the viewer and emphasizing her demise. Caravaggio displays huge technical achievements in this work by making a convex surface look concave and Medusa’s head appear to project outward.",1171,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/00142/images/57726d7cedc2cb3880b47b1a/caravaggio-medusa-google-art-project.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

At that time, the opera was still housed in the rue Le Peletier and had not yet moved to the building designed by Garnier which was soon to replace it. From the 1870s until his death, Degas's favourite subjects were ballerinas at work, in rehearsal or at rest, and he tirelessly explored the theme with many variations in posture and gesture.
More than the stage performance and the limelight, it was the training and rehearsals that interested him. Here the class is coming to an end – the pupils are exhausted, they are stretching, twisting to scratch their backs, adjusting their hair or clothes, an earring, or a ribbon, paying little heed to the inflexible teacher, a portrait of Jules Perrot, a real-life ballet master.

Degas closely observed the most spontaneous, natural, ordinary gestures, the pauses when concentration is relaxed and the body slumps after the exhausting effort of practising and the implacable rigour of the class.

The slightly raised viewpoint looking diagonally across the studio accentuates the vanishing perspective of floor boards. Paul Valéry wrote: ""Degas is one of the very few painters who gave the ground its true importance. He has some admirable floors"". This is all the more appropriate for dancers in that the parquet, which was moistened to prevent slipping, is their main work tool. And the ballet master beats time on the floor with his baton.",1045,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00168/images/edgar-degas/edgar-degas-the-ballet-class.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

From the 1880s Waterhouse exhibited at the Royal Academy and the New Gallery both complex compositions with many figures as well as single figures often taken from literature or Greek mythology. It is possible that Waterhouse's painting of 'A Mermaid' was inspired by Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem 'The Mermaid' (1830) which includes the lines:
Who would be/
A mermaid fair/
Singing alone/
Combing her hair.

Tennyson's poem goes on to describe the mermaid seeking and finding love among the mermen.

Of the bold merry mermen under the sea/
They would sue me, and woo me, and flatter me/
In the purple twilights under the sea/
But the king of them all would carry me/
Woo me, and win me, and marry me.

However Waterhouse was also interested in the darker mythology of the mermaid as an enchantress. Mermaids traditionally were sirens who lured sailors to their death through their captivating song. They were also tragic figures as mermaids could not survive in the human world which they yearned for and men could not exist in their watery realm, so any relationship was doomed. In Waterhouse's painting no sailors are depicted so that despite being a 'siren' the mermaid is shown as an alluring rather lonely figure, albeit with a fish tail. The atmosphere evoked is one of gentle melancholy as the mermaid sits alone in an isolated inlet, dreamily combing out her long hair with her lips parted in song. Beside her is a shell filled with pearls, which some believed to be formed from the tears of dead sailors.

When the work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1901 the Art Journal noted her 'wistful-sad look' and the review remarked that 'it tells of the human longings never to be satisfied … The chill of the sea lies ever on her heart; the endless murmur of the waters is a poor substitute for the sound of human voices; never can this beautiful creature, troubled with emotion, experience on the one hand unawakened repose, on the other the joys of womanhood'.",833,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/john-william-waterhouse/a-mermaid-1900.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The milkmaid is fully absorbed in her activity, carefully pouring the milk. Even though the surrounding objects indicate that the milkmaid is in a kitchen, the indoor setting was kept relatively bare. X-ray studies of the painting show that Vermeer decided to eliminate a wall hanging, probably a map, from the back wall. Additionally, there was a basket of clothes in the right corner that the artist replaced with a footwarmer. By making these adjustments, the artist placed greater emphasis on the milkmaid and her activity. 

This representation stands in contrast to other depictions of servants by his contemporaries, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolaes-maes/the-idle-servant-1655][i]The idle servant[/i][/url] (1655) by Dutch Golden Age painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolaes-maes]Nicolaes Maes[/url]. In [i]The idle servant[/i], Maes constructs a narrative, the kitchen maid that fell asleep in front of a heap of dishes and then was found by her mistress. Like most genre paintings, this painting has a moral aspect: the mistress gestures towards the sleeping maid and the dishes, as a warning against idleness. In comparison, [i]The Milkmaid[/i] does not present a story or anecdote, it simply describes a moment in time. For this reason, Vermeer’s composition displays only a limited space, directing the viewer’s attention to the milkmaid’s activity.
 
Vermeer’s milkmaid has a strong physical presence, created through expert use of light and shade. The light source is coming from the window and immersing the milkmaid in daylight. The artist created a light and dark contrast between the maid and the rear wall, in which the shaded parts of the wall correspond to where the light falls on the woman’s figure. Similarly, on the right side, the wall is lightest in order to enhance the shaded portion of the maid’s figure. Vermeer also emphasized her silhouette by painting a white contour line along her arm and shoulder. It was suggested that the pose of Vermeer’s milkmaid was inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-fiasella]Domenico Fiasella[/url]’s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-fiasella/queen-artemisia-1645][i]Queen Artemisia[/i][/url] (ca. 1645).  Generally speaking, it would be unusual for an artist to base a genre painting of a kitchen maid on a portrait of an ancient Greek queen. However, given Vermeer’s deviation from common depictions of servants in [i]The Milkmaid[/i], the connection to Fiasella’s [i]Artemisia[/i] becomes more plausible. Vermeer depicted his milkmaid with empathy and dignity, and according to some the character also conveys morality. The portrayal of the maid concentrated on her work can relate to virtuosity and modesty, ideals of womanhood in Dutch 17th century society. The milkmaid displays her virtue through her diligent preparation of food. There are some elements in the painting that are indicative of romantic love, namely the footwarmer and the cupid tiles bordering the lower edge of the floor. However, because both of these are not prominent in the painting, it is unlikely that romantic love is the central theme. In this context, the footwarmer and the tiles symbolize human caring and the maid’s devotion toward others. In this way, these elements contribute to the central theme of the milkmaid pouring milk and providing nourishment.",1070,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/johannes-vermeer/the-milkmaid.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Such as those that were formulated in Florentine intellectual circles, created by the Medici family. There are many interpretations proposed to dissolve the message of this work, made up of symbols and allegories. The characters can be identified on the basis of the comparison with different literary sources: the poem [i]Stanze for the carousel[/i] by Angelo Poliziano, contemporary of Botticelli, or with the texts of Latin authors most read in the 15th century, such as Lucrezio, Ovidio, Orazio.

The painted scene takes place in the garden of the Hesperides, the garden of the gods where the golden apples grow, identified in the Renaissance with the earthy oranges and lemons (which is why in the courts of Italian nobles there was always a citrus grove). The flowery lawn is rich in many different types of wildflowers. The characters are divided into groups. On the right there is a narrative scene: Zephyrus, the biting wind that announces spring in March, tries to kidnap the nymph Flora, who, frightened, tries to escape the kidnapping. In the end, Flora, possessed by the god, would agree to marry him and, as a gift, would be transformed into Flora, the Spring, eternally young and fruitful divinity. 

In the center of the painting is Venus, goddess of sacred love, leaning against a myrtle bush, the sacred plant that symbolizes her. Above her, Cupid flies high, blindfolded. His wings come out of the painting, he launches a fiery arrow towards the Three Graces, the three successive figures of the work, intent in a dance in a circle. The last character, on the left, is Mercury, the messenger god, which can be recognized by the winged shoes and the [i]petasus[/i], the typically pointed hat of travelers. The god, with his rod, the [i]caduceus[/i], keeps away the clouds that threaten this ideal and eternal garden, where everything is a harmony of forms and feelings, a perfect microcosm, mirror of a universal macrocosm.

Framed by the plants of the garden, the characters are painted by Botticelli with graceful poses and seem to barely touch the lawn of flowers, as if they were very light. Botticelli has no interest in weighing the muscles of the figures: he paints them sinuously, using curves and not right angles, to give the idea of characters out of time. For this reason, the painter also chooses bright colors, sometimes transparent, as in the dress of the nymph or graces. Botticelli inserted more than five hundred plant species into the painting, of which only two hundred were coming from Tuscany, making this art a herbarium in painting.

However, the possibility of identifying the characters does not exhaust the meaning of the work of art. Venus, in a central position, is here painted not as the goddess of love but, as the Humanists considered her, goddess of [i]humanitas[/i], intellectual activities that elevated men from the world of the senses, personified by Zephyr, to the world of reason, Mercury. For this reason, Zephyr and Mercury are placed at two opposite poles of the painting. The makers of this process are the three Graces, seen in the Renaissance as an allegory of intellectual faculties.

Two of the Graces wear jewelry from the Medici family at their necks, making explicit a political meaning of the painting, that can be read as an allegory of the task of the Medici family in Florence. The only lineage that, being patron and protector of artists, can ignite this process of elevation and the flowering of Florence, which could be the place of the intellectual Spring of the new world, reborn in the Renaissance. This thesis is supported by a documentary source that says that the painting was commissioned to Botticelli in 1478, for the birth of Giulio, son of Giuliano de Medici, brother of Lorenzo the Magnificent.

The portrayed woman is one of his two daughters from his marriage with Kitty Garman (a daughter of a sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-epstein]Jacob Epstein[/url]).

What is quite innovative in Freud’s approach to the depicted subject, is the perspective. The artist represents a lying body completely turned away from us, so we cannot see the facial expression - but still, the painting is quite expressive. The body is curled up in the fetal position, which can be interpreted as a reaction to a physical or psychological trauma. Representing his sleeping daughter like this, Freud may be suggesting that he is a helpless observer of her mental and emotional pain. He also is putting the viewer into a position of a voyeur who intrudes a woman’s personal space and gets the insight of how she feels. Besides, this painting could be read in a feminist key - a woman is expressing her trauma only when she is sleeping, only when she is unaware that others are watching.

In his paintings, Freud demonstrates a tangibility of humans - be it their emotional pain and struggle, or be it naturalism in depicting of their bodies. This tangibility of Annabel is shown in a brute physicality of her feet. The artist emphasizes small details, like motion of muscles and texture of the skin. He de-idealizes the human body, breaking with the tradition of representing a female figure as a beautiful and flawless object,  and insists on the corporeality of all bodies. This de-idealization reminds us of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url]’s realism, which can be seen in his works such as [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/madonna-of-loreto]Madonna of Loreto[/url][/i], [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/entombment]Entombment of Christ[/url][/i] or [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/crucifixion-of-saint-peter-1601]Crucifixion of Saint Peter[/url][/i].

Unconventional poses were one of Freud's specialties. The subject matter is conventional, but the pose is one rarely, if ever, seen in traditional Western portraiture. The subject is Tim Behrens, a friend and student at Slade School of Art, where Freud was a visiting teacher. The work's generic title, giving no hint of the specifics of the sitter or the setting, reflects the consistent, clinical detachment with which Freud approached all subjects, no matter what their relationship to him. Red Haired Man on a Chair (1962) depicts Behrens perched with his knees tucked under him, dressed in a gray suit, and with his brown shoes resting on a chair that appears to tilt toward us. The wooden post and discarded pile of cloths behind him indicate that the environment is the painting studio. At this point in his career, Freud made a transition from sable to hog-hair brushes which allowed both greater control and an ability to apply broad strokes in the heavily impastoed style one sees here.

It is clear that Freud has reached a new level of sophistication. Witness, for example, the linear tension between the figure and the post inches away, giving the appearance that if he leans a little more to the left he might actually touch it. Witness, too, the relationship between the vertical figure and the horizontal line of rags in the background, which forms a cross. Freud was not remotely religious, and certainly not Catholic, so this is a clever reference to the pose his student was holding, which was wildly uncomfortable and underscores his student's position as a martyr for the cause of great art. The observation, more sadistic than empathetic, characterizes Freud's approach to the human form, in particular his ability to suspend empathy with the sitter in order to observe him or her more closely. It is also one of the first examples of the appearance of rags strewn about in loose piles, a common compositional device in Freud's later portraits.",737,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/lucian-freud/red-haired-man-on-a-chair-1963.jpg,740

Although the figures in the painting are set in naturalistic and plausible poses, they are ostentatiously dressed in their finest clothing and jewelry. Modern critics have many interpretations about the paintings style and placement of the figures. Goya’s aversion to flatter the appearance of the figures may be his commentary on the corruption of King Charles IV. Furthermore, the placement of the Queen Louisa in the center of the painting may be an indication of her real power.

Hopper's wife, Jo, served as the model for the woman.  However, Hopper altered her face to make her younger (Jo was 44 in 1927). He also altered her figure; Jo was a curvy, full-figured woman, while one critic has described the woman in the painting as ""'boyish' (that is, flat-chested)"" 
As is often the case in Hopper's paintings, both the woman's circumstances and her mood are ambiguous. She is well-dressed and is wearing makeup, which could indicate either that she is on her way to or from work at a job where personal appearance is important, or that she is on her way to or from a social occasion.
She has removed only one glove, which may indicate either that she is distracted, that she is in a hurry and can stop only for a moment, or simply that she has just come in from outside, and has not yet warmed up. But the latter possibility seems unlikely, for there is a small empty plate on the table, in front of her cup and saucer, suggesting that she may have eaten a snack and been sitting at this spot for some time.",800,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/edward-hopper/automat-1927.jpg,635

Sunday was the time that middle-class Parisians escaped the city to enjoy the outdoors. The people primarily gather in small groups of two or three or sit alone in proximity to others. It is the relationship between these people that creates a sense of modernity, with its distance and disconnection, and nervous tension that lends the work an air of mystery.

Using a grid system and applying small dots of paint, Seurat took two years to complete this large-scale painting. He went to the park often, observing and making over 60 preliminary studies, including 15 in oil. Invoking Greek classical art, Seurat explained, ""The Panathenaeans of Phidias formed a procession. I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color."" Seurat hoped to capture the permanence, or essential forms, behind the fleeting moments. Everyone here is caught in a still pose, except for the child in the orange dress skipping off into the trees, the man on the far left playing trombone, and the furious little dog at the lower right. However, it seems a stillness that might burst into movement at any moment, just as the upper half of the painting moves into the sunlight and the boats in the distance cut across the river. While Seurat invoked classical and Egyptian figures, some have interpreted the overall static effect of the composition and the stiffness of the poses as a critique of the artificiality of modern society and the boredom of middle-class life.",1784,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00142/images/57726d80edc2cb3880b482e1/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-georges-seurat-1884.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Two paintings, one by Manet and one by Renoir, done simultaneously on a summer afternoon, capture a moment of peaceful calm in the Monet's garden. In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: ""Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor [url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436965]painting[/url] of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy! Since you are his friend, tell him to give up painting!'"" However later, as a celebrator of beauty, and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that ""Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau"". While many Impressionist painters focused on landscapes, Renoir painted people in intimate and candid moments. Renoir’s works are also notable for their use of vibrant light and color. His style emphasized freely brushed touches of color, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings.",1650,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/pierre-auguste-renoir/camille-monet-and-her-son-jean-in-the-garden-at-argenteuil-1874.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

As one of his earlier works, it gives an inkling as to the extent to which the artist was willing to abstract realistic forms in order to suit his own artistic tastes. During the time this painting was created, Mondrian began developing his philosophical ideas on theosophy and anthroposophy, two spiritual movements which allowed Mondrian to see painting as a search for spiritual knowledge within oneself. Although his earlier works depicted dim figures or abstracted colors, his search for spiritual enlightenment within and throughout his paintings was to lead through a pathway of more abstract forms.

[i]The Card Players[/i] (1890-1892) at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, is the largest and the most elaborate painting of the series. The Barnes version is a five-figure composition and the only one that includes the figure of the young boy who observes the card game. A more condensed version of this painting is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/the-card-players-1893][i]The Card Players[/i][/url] (1890-1892) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, that has only four figures and a less detailed background. The other three paintings in the series are two-figure compositions, depicting two card players sitting opposite each other.

It was generally assumed that Cézanne first worked on the multi-figure paintings and then moved on to the simpler compositions featuring only two card players. However, recent technical examinations of the canvases indicate that the opposite was true. Scans revealed that the Metropolitan version was extensively reworked, much more than the larger canvas (135.3 x 181.9) in the Barnes Foundation. Therefore, it seems more likely that Cézanne expanded the composition, adding more figures and elements as he painted the series. Cézanne carefully crafted each painting, basing them on multiple preparatory sketches and figure studies he made of local farmers. For example, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/man-with-a-pipe-study-for-the-card-players-1890][i]Man with a Pipe (Study for The Card Players)[/i][/url] (1890-1892) was a study of the figure leaning against the wall in the paintings from the Barnes Foundation and the Metropolitan Museum.

The series was the artist’s chief contribution to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting]genre painting[/url] – a genre that focused on everyday life, depicting people engaged in mundane activities. Cézanne adopted the motif of card players from 17th century Dutch and French genre paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/card-players][i]Card Players in an Interior[/i][/url] (c. 1660) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen]Jan Steen[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/le-nain-brothers/card-players][i]The Card Players (Les joueurs de cartes)[/i][/url] (c. 1635-1640) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/le-nain-brothers]Le Nain brothers[/url]. In comparison to his predecessors, Cézanne’s paintings lack drama and narrative. Instead, his paintings have a simple setting with subdued figures smoking their pipes and playing cards. Cézanne’s card players show little expression, appearing passive and reserved or immersed in their respective tasks. The artist also limited the facial expressions of the players: their facial features were usually painted in a few strokes that marked their shadowed or downcast eyes.

Art historians also suggest that Cézanne’s composition was influenced by the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] masters. Possible prototypes include [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/supper-at-emmaus][i]Supper at Emmaus[/i][/url] (c. 1530) and a lost painting by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini]Giovanni Bellini[/url] of the same subject (c. 1490), that is known through copies and engravings. Similarly, Cézanne used the arrangement of the elements below the tabletop to create a counterpoint to the figures in the composition. This could also reflect the artist’s desire to enhance the everyday scene of card players with the monumentality of a religious subject. Others suggest that Cézanne treated [i]The Card Players[/i] like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_still-life,resultType:masonry]his still life paintings[/url], animating the surface with sequences of color contrasts, that alternate between light and dark, warm and cool hues. In the Barnes version, this is evident in details like the patterned tabletop that is formed through the color contrast between light blue and deep shades of red and violet.",1161,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/paul-cezanne/the-card-players-1892.jpg,858

Like many of her earliest subjects, it derived from popular illustration—in this case, a well-known Currier & Ives lithograph. Although Moses did at the very start of her career sometimes copy compositions verbatim, she never tried to duplicate this Currier & Ives print. Rather, from the start she freely combined elements from her primary source with vignettes from other sources and from her own imagination. Certain stock images do tend to recur in the ""Sugaring Off"" paintings, however, among them the burning cauldron, the mother pouring maple sugar on the snow (where it would harden into instant candy), the men with buckets, and the little ""sugar house.""
Sugaring Off dates from 1943, at the height of Grandma Moses' first truly mature style. She had by this point in her career gained formidable mastery of her medium. She was capable of rendering details with pristine clarity and of handling extremely complex compositions. Sugaring Off is notable for its vast assortment of disparate activities, arrayed in a preternaturally broad landscape. This opening up of the landscape into an almost square, quiltlike panoply of detail is one of the hallmarks of the ""Grandma Moses style."" As she matured further, however, Moses would revert to narrower horizontals, which required greater compression of detail.",800,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/grandma-moses/sugaring-off-1943.jpg,682

Freud's friends introduced them, hoping that Bowery's flamboyant style, which included bright colors and sequins, would inspire Freud to abandon his usual drab palette. Being obstinate, Freud asked Bowery to shave his whole body. Freud saw Bowery's muscular legs as his best feature, and often showcases them in a series of unusually unselfconscious and passive poses that thwart the conventions of male portraiture.

In Man with Leg Up, Bowery lies on the floor with his legs splayed. One leg rests on the bed while the other bends underneath him, as if keeping him from sliding down the floor, which tilts toward us. Nearly all elements in this scene, from the supine pose to the splayed legs indicates vulnerability. Exaggerated foreshortening makes Bowery's top half appear further away, highlighting the exposure of his hairless groin, which occupies the very center of the picture. Bowery seems at ease with this. His facial features are relaxed. His left arm cradles his head while his right is draped across his chest, regarding us as if to say, ""so what""?

The two men developed a friendship, and Freud continued to paint Bowery over the course of four years, until his death from AIDS in 1994.",400,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/lucian-freud/man-with-leg-up.jpg,329

Before long, Repin started to paint the second version. He worked in his country house not far from St.Petersburg; the room portrayed in the picture was artist’s living room. As models for female characters, he used his wife, mother-in-law, and his daughter.
In a year Unexpected Visitors was exposed in a Traveling Art Exhibition. However, the artist continued to improve this picture within next four years. In particularly, he repainted the face of the young man (a political exile who unexpectedly came back home) four times in search of a proper expression. It is generally believed that by depicting various reaction of young man’s household Repin tried to show diverse but mostly positive attitude of society toward revolutionary movements of that time. Actually, under strict censorship of Czarist Russia, it was a political declaration disguised as an everyday genre scene.

What Are We? Where Are We Going?[/i] (1897-98) was created in Tahiti during a time of the artist's great personal crisis. Struggling to find recognition and success in Paris, Gauguin decided to move permanently to Tahiti in 1895. There he continued to struggle: plagued by illness and mounting debt, his mental health rapidly deteriorated. Around the same time, he learned that his beloved daughter Aline died of pneumonia. At this low point, he summoned his strength to paint [i]Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?[/i], a masterpiece that was a summation of his artistic ideas. He wrote: “I have put all my energy into it one more time before I die, so painful a passion in such dreadful circumstances, so clear and accurate a vision, that there is no trace of precociousness and life blossoms forth from it”.

The painting, which should be viewed from right to left, represents the spectrum of human activity throughout one’s life, from birth to death. The thread of the composition corresponds with the questions posed in the title of the painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? The boundaries of the scene are marked by the newborn child lying in the grass on the right, and the haggard old woman, who glumly reflects on the past. Between these two, Gauguin creates a dreamlike vision that describes the daily existence of adulthood. In the background, he included a couple walking and an exotic blue idol, which, according to Gauguin, symbolized ‘the Beyond'. The large canvas features some of Gauguin’s favorite subjects, such as the reclining nude, the group of figures lost in thought, and the cult statue.

The painting expressed Gauguin’s highly personal mythology, which was developed through the combination and adaption of symbols from a variety of Western and non-Western sources. In particular, the scene reflects the influence of Tahiti, its tropical landscape, and native Polynesian culture. Gauguin wanted the painting to evoke associative meanings, rather than explain explicitly the meaning of his symbolism. His symbolism expressed the inner world of visions and emotions, which was purposefully enigmatic and ambiguous. Gauguin wanted to interpret life as a great mystery, and in the painting, he emphasized the lack of understanding of the world.

After he completed the painting, Gauguin sent it to Paris to the art collector George-Daniel de Monfreid. Shortly after the artist retreated to the hills where he intended to poison himself by drinking arsenic. Gauguin’s suicide attempt failed, and he gradually recovered in the hospital. In the meantime, Monfried managed to sell the painting for a thousand francs, something that helped Gauguin’s spirits. Today the painting is part of the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.",1920,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00129/images/paul-gauguin/where-do-we-come-from-what-are-we-where-are-we-going.jpg!HD.jpg,730

The painting depicted the scene with an unflattering air, and it did not romanticize the depictions of grief and mourning, as in traditional Romantic paintings. Critics of the piece decried both the style of the painting as well as the size. At 10 feet tall by 22 feet wide, the size of the canvas was typically reserved for religious or heroic scenes, and the painting critics said was intentionally ugly and harsh. For the subjects in the painting, Courbet also used the real people who had actually been at the burial, rather than actors used as models for the art. As it had such a deleterious effect on the Romantic style of painting, it could also be easily called “The Burial of Romanticism,” as Courbet himself said: “The Burial at Ornans was in reality the burial of Romanticism.”

This 22 foot long canvas situated in a main room at the Musee d'Orsay buries the viewer as if he or she were in a cave. In a decidedly non-classical composition, figures mill about in the darkness, unfocused on ceremony. As a prime example of Realism, the painting sticks to the facts of a real burial and avoids amplified spiritual connotations. Emphasizing the temporal nature of life, Courbet intentionally did not let the light in the painting express the eternal. While sunset could have expressed the great transition of the soul from the temporal to the eternal, Courbet covered the evening sky with clouds so the passage of day into night is just a simple echo of the coffin passing from light into the dark of the ground. Some critics saw the adherence to the strict facts of death as slighting religion and criticized it as a shabbily composed structure with worn-faced working folk raised up to life-size in a gigantic work as if they had some kind of noble importance. Other critics such as Proudhon loved the inference of equality and virtue of all people and recognized how such a painting could help turn the course of Western art and politics.",1920,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/00129/images/gustave-courbet/a-burial-at-ornans.jpg!HD.jpg,882

The portrait depicts [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, who founded [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url] together with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque]Georges Braque[/url]. Picasso was a defining figure in Gris’s artistic development, and the painting honors him as a mentor. In 1906, Gris moved to Paris and settled in the Montmartre neighborhood. Soon after, he met Picasso, who introduced him to the leading painters, poets, and critics of the new generation like Braque, Guillaume Apollinaire, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-jacob]Max Jacob[/url], Maurice Raynal, and Pierre Reverdy. In his first years in Paris, Gris worked as a graphic artist, drawing illustrations for various political and satirical magazines. Influenced by his environment, he began to paint seriously in 1910, and the following year he decided to fully devote his time to painting. In a relatively short period of time, Gris began producing works comparable in quality to those of his older and more experienced colleagues.

Gris decided to make his artistic debut with [i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] at the 1912 Salon of Independent Artists. Gris depicts Picasso as a painter, holding a palette in his hand. The inscription at the bottom right of the painting, “Hommage à Pablo Picasso” exhibits Gris’s respect for Picasso as a leader and innovator. The portrait draws from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/analytical-cubism]Analytical Cubism[/url], the early phase of Cubism that lasted from 1908 to 1912. The term Analytical Cubism describes the analytical approach to the subject matter: the artist deconstructs the subject by depicting it simultaneously from multiple points of view. In the portrait, Gris deconstructed the figure by fracturing the head, neck, and torso into various planes and geometric shapes. Gris created a very organized composition with a regulated structure of diagonals. The painting has limited to a palette of cool tones of blue, brown, and grey. This was also characteristic of Analytic Cubism because a simplified color palette further emphasized the structure of the forms. What distinguished the portrait was the contrast produced by the blues, browns, and grey that gave the colors a luminous quality.

The painting was also an homage to Picasso as an artist, and more specifically it relates to the portraits Picasso painted in 1910: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-ambroise-vollard-1910][i]Portrait of Ambroise Vollard[/i][/url] (1910), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-daniel-henry-kahnweiler-1910][i]Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler[/i][/url] (1910), and [[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-wilhelm-uhde-1910]i]Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde[/i][/url] (1910). [i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] was also linked to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-metzinger/le-go-ter-1911][i]Tea Time[/i][/url] (1911), a portrait by French painter and theorist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-metzinger]Jean Metzinger[/url]. According to some scholars, Gris was so impressed by [i]Tea Time[/i] that he became convinced of the importance of mathematics, and the two paintings have a similar grid structure. [i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] was an artistic homage to Picasso’s innovations, who with Georges Braque paved the way for other Cubist painters like Gris. At the same time, the painting showed Gris’s artistic skill and maturity and is considered one of his early artistic achievements.

Day of the Gods (Mahana No Atua), one of the very few paintings Gauguin completed during this period, is closely related to his literary project. Set in a Tahitian landscape by the sea, the composition is divided into three horizontal bands. At the top, islanders perform a ritual near a towering sculpture. Like many figures in Gauguin’s Tahitian images, the monumental sculpture was derived not from local religion but from photographs of carved reliefs adorning the Buddhist temple complex at Borobudur (Java). In the middle band, three symmetrically arranged figures are placed against a field of pink earth in poses that may signify birth, life, and death. The woman in the center, formally linked to the sculpture at the top, is similar in appearance to other depictions of Tahitian females who Gauguin used to suggest the Christian figure of Eve in paradise. The lower portion of the composition evokes brilliant, contrasting hues reflected in the water. Gauguin’s Post-Impressionist style, defined by a decreasing tendency to depict real objects and the expressive use of flat, curving shapes of vibrant color, influenced many abstract painters of the early 20th century.",800,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/paul-gauguin/a-day-of-no-gods-1894.jpg,590

The picture was based on the earlier work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/the-sleeping-venus-1510][i]The Sleeping Venus[/i][/url] (1510) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione]Giorgione[/url], a close friend of the artist, although Titian's interpretation of the goddess is much more erotic. This sensuality is heightened by the directness of the nude's gaze, her faint smile, and her awareness of the viewer, along with the depiction of her in an opulent domestic environment without the allegorical or mythological symbols traditionally associated with Venus. While Giorgione's nude is idealized and demure, Titian's is realistic and tempting. The warm, light tones of her skin are in contrast to the darker, more affluent background, and the play of light on her body and subtle use of [i]chiaroscuro[/i] gives a sculptural quality to the nude. Her curves also contrast with the regularity of architectural elements, including the tiled floor, classical column, and green hanging, which bisects the scene, highlighting the fertile center of the figure.

Titian's exceptional talent, his bold depiction of female sensuality, and his status as the leading Venetian painter of the Cinquecento is why this picture is often cited as the origin of many of Western art's most controversial images - including, for instance, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/nude-maja-1800][i]The Nude Maja[/i][/url] (c.1797) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya]Goya[/url], as well as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Edouard Manet[/url] - and is considered to be the original precursor to the pin-up.

Titian painted this picture for the Duke of Camerino Guidobaldo della Rovere, who later became the Duke of Urbino, possibly to celebrate his marriage to Giuliana Varano. Despite her erotic air, Titian's Venus is no courtesan, and the painting is not a subtle promotion of casual infidelity. On the contrary, given that it was painted to commemorate Guidobaldo's marriage, it is almost certainly celebrating marital love and the physical intimacy between man and wife, a supposition supported by a number of details. In her right hand, for instance, the girl holds a posy of roses, which usually symbolize love; also, the sleeping dog is a common symbol of fidelity; lastly, the maids in the background are depicted rummaging in a traditional [i]cassone[/i], where wives commonly stored their [i]trousseaux[/i]. Perhaps the picture was conceived as an ideal model of behavior for Giuliana, the Duke's young bride. It was certainly not uncommon for pictures of an explicitly erotic nature to be commissioned to celebrate a wedding, although they would be intended for private viewing only.

[i]The Venus of Urbino[/i] is full of artistic devices. To begin with, Titian achieves a beautiful contrast between the voluptuous curves of the girl's body and the vertical and horizontal lines of the dividing screen, floor tiles, and other architectural elements. The play of light on the girl's body and Titian's delicate [i]chiaroscuro[/i] lends a sculptural quality to her figure and also enhances the silky drapery of the bedsheets. The floor tiles provide an extra linear perspective, while the floral patterns of the couch, [i]cassoni[/i], and background tapestry - in conjunction with the rich color pigments of the screen and the maid's costume - help to unify and activate the composition.

By the time he executed this work, Titian was established as the leading master of Renaissance art in Venice. Above all, he was known for his remarkable use of color, and his works - which spanned all the major genres, including church altarpieces, mythological painting, portrait art, and pastoral landscape - were increasingly sought after by members of Italian Royal Houses. He went on to become recognized as a genius in his own time and has since been revered by such Old Masters as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Van Dyck[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Poussin[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens]Rubens[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Velazquez[/url]. In many subjects and painting genres, he set patterns that were copied by generations of painters, especially in portraiture. Unfortunately, his talent as an artist was not matched by his generosity of spirit: he became notorious for his greed and miserliness.",1665,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/titian/venus-of-urbino-1538.jpg,1196

In 1975, an unemployed school teacher attacked the work, leaving a large section of zig-zags scratches. The painting was successfully restored, although the scratches are still somewhat visible.

Renoir often included his friends and acquaintances in his paintings, and this one is no different.

Afterward, she decided to produce a sequence of ten prints that would depict the daily life of a contemporary woman. The completed series contained depictions of women getting ready, washing their children, having tea, and more. This particular piece portrays a woman sealing a letter at her desk. The composition creates balance by combining patterns (the wallpaper and the woman's dress) with solid areas of color (the vertical back of the desk and the paper of the letter and envelope). The viewer is drawn into the shallow space of the room, where the skewed writing panel of the desk illustrates the use of forced perspective. These artistic choices were influenced by traditional Japanese printmaking, but the woman's clothing and other objects are all contemporary elements of Cassatt's world.

Mary Cassatt often depicted the private lives of women and children in her paintings. The Letter is one such painting, which she created in the Japanese wood block print style. The graphic decorations on the woman’s dress, as well as the wallpaper behind her, indicate the extent of Japanese art on her style. The artwork, which depicts a woman sitting at a desk inside, mailing an envelope, is a more than just a quaint genre painting. By painting the woman indoors, Cassatt was making a statement about the way women were treated. In this case, the woman is sitting inside in solitude, due to the fact that social mores restricted the activities that she could do outside the home.",722,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/mary-cassatt/the-letter-1891.jpg,1106

[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Dürer’s self-portraits[/url] are not only among the earliest examples of the genre, but are also some of the finest works of self-portraiture ever produced in Western art.  [i]Self Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight[/i] (1500) is particularly significant; it is an artistic proclamation that is deeply tied to how Durer wanted to position himself in the context of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/northern-renaissance#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Northern Renaissance[/url] and the Humanist movement.

The self-portrait gave Dürer the opportunity to display the breadth of his technical skill, particularly in creating the textures of his luscious hair and rich fur. It is likely that the portrait remained in Dürer’s cabinet, exhibited in private viewings to impress prospective clients and used for demonstrations to his students. In the self-portrait, the artist adorns a fashionable brown coat with a fur trim, a garment worn by 15th century noblemen. The garment is a symbol of social status, and indicates Dürer’s climb on the social ladder. This also represents the new status of artists in the Renaissance, where they were elevated from anonymity, and recognized publicly as creators and not mere craftsmen. The self-portrait is accompanied by the inscription: [i]“I, Albrecht Durer of Nuremberg painted myself thus, with undying colors, at the age of twenty eight years”[/i]. In the Medieval era, the age twenty eight signified the transition to maturity. The inscription plays up this symbolism, signifying the artist entering a new era.

The frontal portrait is highly unusual for a secular portrait. It deliberately invites the comparison to the image of Christ, particularly to the iconography of Christ as [i]Salvator Mundi[/i] (Savior of the World). The self-portrait evokes the concept of [i]Imitatio Christi[/i], the ideal of imitating and following the Christ. It is possible that Dürer emphasized the biblical idea that Man was created in God’s image, and through the self-portrait he was asserting that his creativity originates in divine grace. However, Dürer’s use of religious iconography also expresses humanist values. The frontal portrait exemplifies symmetry and harmony, ideals praised by ancient writers such as Cicero and Vitruvius, and promoted by Italian Renaissance humanist Leon Battista Alberti. Dürer, and in particularly this self-portrait, were praised by German Renaissance humanist, Konrad Celtes. 

Dürer and Celtes, along with other German humanists were proponents of the Northern Renaissance, and had the ambition to bring forward a cultural Golden Age. In a text addressed to Dürer, Celtes links him to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], a renowned painter of Ancient Greece. Celtes called Dürer the “second Apelles”, and indeed in the self-portrait Dürer presents himself as a Christian Apelles. The dark and minimal color scheme of the self-portrait may have been inspired by Apelles, who was celebrated for his four color system of painting and his dark, glossy glaze. Therefore, [i]Self Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight[/i] can be understood as an artistic statement, Dürer absorbing the praise of his contemporaries and reaffirming his position as the “new Apelles” of the Northern Renaissance.",856,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/albrecht-durer/self-portrait-at-the-age-of-twenty-eight-1500.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The viewer's gaze is directed past the menu cards and the vividly painted foods in the window display and the waitress who leans forward to adjust them, into an interior of polished wood, tiled floors, and wall mirrors where a man and woman eat and a cashier attends to business at her register. Hopper painted this large canvas in the studio, working from sketches that he had made of local restaurants. Yet despite the bright lighting and the warm, even garish, colors, this is not a particularly festive scene. The two diners chat between themselves, but the cashier and the waitress are lost in their separate thoughts and duties. As in many of his works, Hopper indirectly comments on the loneliness and weariness that so many city dwellers experience.
Despite Hopper's reluctance to assign historical context to his work, this painting also speaks of several social changes of the era. For example, it represents the new roles that women were occupying in public; both the cashier and the waitress, for example, are women working outside the home. The title also alludes to a recent social innovation, in which dining establishments advertised ""tables for ladies"" in order to welcome their newly mobile female customers. In the past, it had often been assumed that women appearing alone in restaurants or bars were prostitutes in search of business; now, dining on their own or with other women, they would be treated respectfully. In addition, the date of this painting serves as a reminder that Hopper was living in New York during the Great Depression, when many Americans could not afford to dine out, even at such an unpretentious establishment as this one.",1548,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/edward-hopper/tables-for-ladies-1930.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Hopper began 'Office in a Small City' while he was staying in Truro in the summer of 1953, and he finished it in his New York studio in the fall. Rather than depicting the Cape Cod landscape, however, 'Office in a Small City' is a scene that could have taken place in any American town in the mid-twentieth century. Hopper's explanation of his earlier work 'Office at Night' (1940; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis) also applies to this painting: ""My aim was to try to give the sense of an isolated and lonely office interior rather high in the air, with the office furniture which has a very definite meaning to me.""
The solitary office worker in this scene is isolated both physically and emotionally. There is no indication of his particular profession, as he sits in his shirtsleeves; he appears, in fact, to be daydreaming rather than working. The postwar culture of American business is evident in the mass-produced office furniture, the impersonal atmosphere of the office itself, and the man's detachment from his unseen coworkers. Despite the light and air afforded by his corner office, he appears trapped in place. He is framed by the office window, and his head is profiled against another window and the wall of the building beyond, in a manner that suggests his containment within his environment. The solitude of the man, and the contrast between the stark, utilitarian upper story of the building and its decorative false front, visible at the lower right, suggest Hopper's own ambivalence toward modern urban life.",1548,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/edward-hopper/not_detected_235610.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Andres Nunes, the parish priest of Sao Tome, was the commissioner of the work, who intended it for a project to refurbish the Count’s burial chapel. According to the commission, the observers of the burial were to be portraits of the notable men of Toledo at the time.

Unlike Courbet or Millet, Caillebotte does not incorporate any social, moralizing, or political message in his work. His thorough documentary study (gestures, tools, accessories) justifies his position among the most accomplished realists.

Caillebotte had undergone a completely academic training, studying with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leon-bonnat]Bonnat[/url]. The perspective, accentuated by the high angle shot and the alignment of floorboards complies with tradition. The artist drew one by one all the parts of his painting, according to the academic method, before reporting them using the square method on the canvas. The nude torsos of the planers are those of heroes of Antiquity, it would be unimaginable for Parisian workers of those times. But far from closeting himself in academic exercises, Caillebotte exploited their rigor in order to explore the contemporary universe in a completely new way.

Caillebotte presented his painting at the 1875 Salon. The Jury, no doubt shocked by its crude realism, rejected it (some critics talked of ""vulgar subject matter""). The young painter then decided to join the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionists[/url] and presented his painting at the second exhibition of the group in 1876, where [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas]Degas[/url] exhibited his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/woman-ironing-silhouette-1873][i]Woman Ironing[/i][/url] (1873).

The only African figure on the raft waves a cloth at the top of a pile of a few men who are struggling to get the attention of a ship in the distance (located on the far right of the horizon line). The sail of the raft is billowing in the wind while being tossed about a choppy ocean beneath a stormy sky. Géricault paid great attention to the details in this work. He even [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/heads-of-torture-victims-study-for-the-raft-of-the-medusa]sketched severed body parts[/url] in order to make the image as authentic as possible.

The subject depicted is the artist's dramatic interpretation of the events beginning on July 2, 1816, when a French navy frigate crashed on its way to colonies in West Africa. The appointed governor of the colony and the top-ranking officers in the party left on the ship's six lifeboats leaving the remaining 147 passengers to be crowded onto a hastily made raft. When the raft proved too cumbersome, in a horrific act of cowardice and fear, the ship's leader cut the ropes to the raft. Left to fend for themselves for 13 days, the passengers eventually resorted to cannibalism. When rescued by a passing British ship, only 15 men were left alive, of whom 5 died before they were able to reach land. When the public learned of this, it became an international tragedy and a searing indictment of the current French government. 

The decision to paint a scene from contemporary history - one that was utterly of the moment - brought instant attention to this work, particularly as Gericault translated it in a manner befitting classical history painting (large-scale, with heroic and tragic elements). The painting shocked the public and divided critics at the 1819 Salon. The shipwreck had scandalous political implications at home—the incompetent captain, who had gained the position because of connections to the Bourbon Restoration government, fought to save himself and senior officers while leaving the lower ranks to die—and so Géricault’s picture of the raft and its inhabitants was greeted with hostility by the government. Critics were divided: the horror and ""[i]terribilità[/i]"" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a ""pile of corpses,"" whose realism they considered a far cry from the ""ideal beauty"" incarnated by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet]Girodet[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet/pygmalion-et-galat-e-1819][i]Pygmalion and Galatea[/i] [/url](1819) which triumphed the same year. Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Coupin (art critic of the Revue encyclopédique) was categorical: ""Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel.""

Disappointed by the reception of [i]The Raft of the Medusa[/i], Géricault took the painting to England in 1820, where it was received as a sensational success. He remained there for two years, enjoying the equine culture and producing a body of lithographs, watercolors, and oils of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/the-horse-race-1824-1]jockeys and horses[/url]. 

This work is a key example of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] painting. In creating it, Géricault showed a complexity of composition and an almost unsettling portrayal of reality, differed from anything that had been seen before.

It combined several influences that marked the emergence of Gorky’s mature original style. The artist blended elements of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url], specifically from the paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Pablo Picasso[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro]Joan Miró[/url]. Additionally, the color range in [i]The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i] can be connected to the works of Russian artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky]Wassily Kandinsky[/url], much admired by Gorky. Another prominent figure that helped in Gorky’s artistic development was Chilean surrealist painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roberto-matta]Roberto Matta[/url]. He advised Gorky to thin his paints with turpentine, which allowed the colors to run, smudge, and drip, acquiring a translucent quality. It made the colors in [i]The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i] more vibrant and sensuous than in earlier works, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/garden-in-sochi][i]The Garden in Sochi[/i][/url] (1943).

Gorky was inspired by nature, his physical surroundings, as well as by memories of his father’s garden in Armenia. The artist aimed to present complexities and contradictions of his life, and so the painting and its title hold multiple layers of meaning. The peculiar title was the result of Gorky’s collaboration with the surrealist André Breton on New Year’s Eve 1944. Breton, the author of the [i]Surrealist Manifesto[/i], praised the artwork, stating it was one of the most famous paintings produced in America. On a superficial level, some shapes resemble livers floating in space, while other crown-like forms are similar to a cock’s combs. However, some have suggested that these shapes were products of the artist’s imagination, and as such, they did not represent any particular object found in nature.

Furthermore, scholars have offered other explanations that give the title a range of meanings. The liver was considered the ancient organ of love, and the phrase [i]cock’s comb[/i] can be interpreted as a sexual pun. In this case, the title could mean that love is lust, making the painting a representation of passion and desire. Therefore, the shapes can signify biological organisms or human reproductive organs freely floating in space. Another possibility is that the pun [i]cock’s comb[/i] refers to conceit or vanity. If the word [i]liver[/i] is understood as the one who lives, the title could be a statement: one who is actively alive already engaged in the greatest of vanities.

The painting was based on a drawing done the previous year, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/study-for-the-liver-is-the-cocks-comb-1943][i]Study for The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i][/url] (1943). It was not uncommon: before creating oil paintings, Gorky usually made several preparatory sketches and studies. In this way, he established the foundations of the painting in terms of color and composition. Still, when working with oil paint, Gorky improvised in some sections by changing color areas or adding new shapes. Overall, Gorky preserved the graphic style seen in the drawing but accentuated the contours and colors, which resulted in a fantastical and mysterious landscape.",1060,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/arshile-gorky/the-liver-is-the-cock-s-comb.jpg,800

For Gauguin, the tropical island held the promise of a ‘primitive paradise’, that was free from the constraints of modern society. However, once he arrived, Gauguin realized that the place he envisioned did not exist: the island was dealing with the impacts of colonialism and modernity, and native customs and culture seemed to be headed towards extinction. In his art, he tried to reimagine this lost paradise and experience the native Polynesian culture and customs.

[i]Spirit of the Dead Watching (Manaò Tupapaú)[/i] (1892) was one of the artist’s best-known works from his[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Period_1st-tahiti-period,resultType:masonry] first visit to Tahiti[/url]. The painting depicts a young Tahitian girl haunted by the Tupapaú, the Polynesian spirit of the dead. The girl in the painting was Teha’amana, Gauguin’s young lover, and ‘native-wife’. In his Tahiti journals [i]Noa Noa[/i], he described the incident that inspired the painting: “One day I had to go to Papeete… I had promised to return that very evening…  It was one in the morning by the time I arrived… The lamp had gone out and when I came home the bedroom was dark. I felt a sort of fear… I struck some matches and saw [what I pictured in my painting Manaò] Tupapaú.” Frightened by the spirits, Teha’amana lies naked on her stomach rigid and tense while glancing sideways toward the viewer.

In [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] Gauguin wanted to represent the Polynesian fear of the Tupapaú, who is depicted as an older woman wearing a black cloak. On the back wall, there are several white forms, that Gauguin described as phosphorescent lights, which symbolize the spirits that haunt the living. Gauguin depicted the figure of the Tupapaú in a similar fashion in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/words-of-the-devil-1892][i]Parau na te Varua ino (Words of the Devil)[/i][/url] (1892). In both cases, the artist juxtaposed the fearful nude figure with the Tupapaú: the Tupapaú is painted in cool tones that contrast the warm shades of the female nudes.

The painting also closely relates to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Édouard Manet[/url], a painting Gauguin greatly admired and even took a photograph of it with him to Tahiti. In the same way that Manet’s [i]Olympia[/i] represented a modern incarnation of Venus, Gauguin wanted to showcase his version of a native Venus. This connection was also established by Gauguin’s European contemporaries, the French writer Alfred Jarry called her ‘a brown Olympia’. [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] was important to Gauguin, he made several versions of the motif in drawings and woodblocks and even featured it in the background of the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/self-portrait-in-a-hat][i]Self-portrait in a Hat[/i][/url] (1893).

As new discourses developed, Gauguin’s [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] prompted new readings and interpretations. Gauguin described his relationship with then thirteen-year-old Teha’amana through the contrasts of youth and old age, of light and darkness and life and death. Given the fact that Gauguin was an older man in the position of taking advantage of his subject, the story behind [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] can take on a different meaning. Did the spirits cause Teha’amana uneasiness or was she frightened by someone she sees beyond the picture plane?

His [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]interest in self-portraiture[/url] was especially pronounced in 1888 and 1889, in part because of his relationship with his fellow artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url]. Gauguin stayed with Van Gogh in Arles for two months in 1888, and afterward, the two continued to exchange artistic ideas through correspondence.

Painted on a cupboard door, [i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] presents an image that is both angelic and demonic. The artist includes three Christian symbols in the painting – the yellow halo over his head, the apples that dangle from a branch on the left, and the snake which he holds in his right hand. Together these symbols reference the biblical story of the Temptation of Adam and Eve and the Fall of Man. By combining these symbols, Gauguin presents himself as both a saint and a sinner or a figure of a fallen angel. This duality is also evident in the composition of the painting: the top half depicts Gauguin with the halo looking away from the temptation (apples) while the bottom half shows grasping the snake. The image possibly reflects the artist’s inner struggle as well as the enigmatic way in which he wished to portray himself to others.

In the painting, there is no sense of spatial dimension, and the large areas of flat colors demonstrate the influence of Japanese prints and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cloisonnism]Cloisonnism[/url] – a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Another important influence in [i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting]ancient Egyptian art[/url] and imagery. The shape of Gauguin’s long hair is similar to the ceremonial wigs of Egyptian gods, Pharaohs, and court officials. Gauguin was familiar with these conventions through the plaster cast of the Giza [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/khafre-enthroned--2570]sculpture of The Pharaoh Khephren[/url] at the Ethnographic Museum of Trocadéro and the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/the-goddess-hathor-welcomes-sethos-i--1069]Relief from the Tomb of Sethos I[/url] at the Louvre. The Egyptian influence is also evident in the way Gauguin paints the hand and the snake. The snake was possibly modeled after the snake symbol featured on Pharaoh’s personal emblem on the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/stele-of-the-serpent-king-stela-of-djet--3000]Stela of Djet[/url] at the Louvre. The grasp of the snake is not realistic, and the hand is depicted from a frontal view which is characteristic of Egyptian reliefs and wall paintings. In the foreground of the painting, Gauguin added an ornamental element of a vine-like plant or flower. The vines could have been modeled after the lotus and the papyrus plant, that were often featured on Egyptian reliefs, sculptures, and wall paintings.  

[i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] is a companion piece to [[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/portrait-of-meyer-de-haan-by-lamplight-1889]i]Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan[/i][/url] (1889). The two works were intended to be part of a decorative panel in Gauguin’s dwelling in the village Le Pouldu. The companion portrait depicts Gauguin’s close friend, the Dutch painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/meijer-de-haan]Meijer de Haan[/url] in the pose of a thinker. The redhaired painter is staring at two books, John Milton’s [i]Paradise Lost[/i] and Thomas Carlyle’s [i]Sartor Resartus[/i], contemplating issues of religion and philosophy. Some have suggested that the portraits address similar themes through different references: both present the artist in a sort of inner struggle and as figures that have a strong connection to the spiritual and mystical realm.",568,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/paul-gauguin/self-portrait-with-halo-1889.jpg,902

The painting depicts the landowner Robert Andrews and his young wife Frances Andrews sitting on a bench in front of an English countryside landscape. The portrait was commissioned in 1750, two years after the couple married in the parish church of All Saints, Sudbury. However, the painting is not a marriage portrait, instead, it likely celebrated the inheritance Andrews received in 1750. Thus, the painting can be considered a ‘triple’ portrait – of Mr. Andrews, his wife, and his land. 

The couple is dressed casually, their attire is suited for an informal outing. Mr. Andrews is wearing a baggy shooting jacket with bags of powder and shot hanging from his pocket. He is holding a long-barreled shotgun and his dog is at his feet. Mrs. Andrews wears a simple light blue skirt and jacket, and a pair of casual heels. The portrait can be categorized as a ‘conversation piece’, a type of group portrait popular in 18th century England. The conversation piece is a kind of informal portrait: it usually depicts a group of family members or friends in a rural or domestic setting.

In this early masterpiece, Gainsborough prominently features the naturalistic landscapes, that dominates the right side of the canvas. The artist was particularly fond of landscape painting, and in this case, he used the landscape to display his painterly skills. He creates the effect of changing weather, depicting stormy skies with patches of light and shadow that fall over the fields and meadows. This technique was common in Dutch 17th-century landscape painting, which influenced Gainsborough’s style of painting. This relatively small piece (69.8 cm × 119.4 cm) was typical of Gainsborough’s work in this early period. His later portraits such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/portrait-of-colonel-john-bullock][i]Portrait of Colonel John Bullock[/i][/url] (ca. 1780) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/mrs-richard-brinsley-sheridan-1786][i]Mrs. Richard Brinsley Sheridan[/i][/url] (1785-1787) were much grandeur and painted on larger, close to life-size formats. In these later works, the figure takes center stage, while the landscape in the background becomes more generalized.

In the painting, Gainsborough left an unpainted patch in Mrs. Andrews's lap. The reason behind this is unknown: some speculate the artist planned to paint a cock pheasant in her lap, which her husband shot while hunting. Others suggest that space was reserved for a baby – the couple, who had nine children in total, had their first child only in 1751. If this was the intention, the portrait would celebrate Mr. Andrew’s authority as a landowner and husband. Mrs. Andrews died in 1780 at age 48, while her husband remarried and died in 1806 at age 80. 

The portrait was largely unknown to the public until it was displayed in an exhibition in Ipswich in 1927. After that, the painting regularly appeared in exhibitions across Britain and abroad. It remained with the family until 1960 when it was sold by Gerald Willoughbury Andrews (a great-great-great-grandson of the sitters). Today, the painting is in the National Gallery, London.",1920,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/thomas-gainsborough/mr-and-mrs-andrews-1749.jpg!HD.jpg,1117

""Late summer was the time for apple butter making,"" Moses wrote in her autobiography. ""The apple butter was considered a necessity.""

To make apple butter, you take two barrels of sweet cider {you grind apples and make sweet cider first), then you put them on in a big brass kettle over afire out in the orchard and start it to boiling. You want three barrels of quartered apples, or snits, as they called them, with cores taken out, and then you commence to feed those in, and stirring and keeping that stirrer going. . . . Womenfolks would keep that going, feeding in all the apples until evening. Then the young folks would come in to start stirring. They'd have two—a boy and a girl—to take hold of the handle. They'd have a regular frolic all night out in the orchard.

Moses' personal recollections—parts of which read like recipes, others like social history—were mirrored in the content of her painting.",800,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/grandma-moses/apple-butter-making-1947(1).jpg,539

Despite her difficulties with the subject, Moses did paint a number of striking interiors. Without the landscape to anchor the scene and provide an element of realism, her interiors rely almost wholly on the artist's command of abstract form and patterning. These qualities are used to maximum advantage in The Quilting Bee, wherein the colors and forms of the large quilt and the elaborate table setting play off neatly against the bright clothing of the numerous bustling characters. Still, Moses could not resist adding a bit of nature beyond the tall, uncurtained windows.",1664,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/grandma-moses/the-quilting-bee.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The three figures form a music ensemble; they play, keep time and sing in harmony. Music functions as a metaphor for harmony in love, and Vermeer’s intimate, quiet scene embodies qualities of moderation and harmony. The setting, furniture and clothes help identify the music players as members of the upper classes. The man playing the lute, for instance, wears an intricate sash and sword, symbols of social status. [i]The Concert[/i] also shares commonalities with Vermeer’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-music-lesson][i]The music lesson[/i][/url] (ca. 1662-1665), another painting in which music is a central theme. For example, in both paintings, Vermeer chose to include the bass viol in the foreground. The additional instrument is a way to amplify the idea of shared pleasure and potential harmony in music and love.

The element of a picture within a picture is recurring in Vermeer’s artwork. Generally speaking, many artists used the picture presented in the background as a way to relate to the central theme of the painting.  In [i]The Concert[/i], there are two painting hanging in on the back wall behind the players. On the left side hangs a pastoral [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/landscape#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]landscape[/url] painting that relates to the landscape painted on the lid of the harpsichord. The second painting on the right side is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dirck-van-baburen]Dirck van Baburen[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dirck-van-baburen/the-procuress-1622][i]The Procuress[/i][/url] (1622). Baburen was an important figure of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/utrecht-school#!#resultType:masonry]Utrecht Caravaggisti[/url], a group of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque#!#resultType:masonry]Baroque[/url] artists influenced by the art of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url], that were mainly based in the Dutch city of Utrecht. [i]The Procuress[/i] depicts a brothel scene, a popular subject in Dutch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]genre painting[/url]. Baburen’s painting is also a composition of three figures: the prostitute, the customer and the procuress. The scene in [i]The Procuress[/i] offers a thematic contrast to Vermeer’s ensemble. While in Baburen’s painting music is associated with illicit love, Vermeer’s musical trio embodies the ideals of harmony and moderation.  [i]The Procuress[/i] also appears in the background of another painting by Vermeer, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/a-young-woman-seated-at-a-virginal-a-lady-seated-at-a-virginal][i]A young woman seated at a virginal[/i][/url] (ca.1670-1672), which was painted approximately six years after [i]The Concert[/i]. There are at least three versions of Baburen’s painting, one of which belonged to Vermeer’s mother in-law, Maria Thins, who owned a collection of art produced by Utrecht Caravaggisti painters.

The first documentation of [i]The Concert[/i] was only in 1780. The painting was acquired in 1892 by art patron and collector, Isabella Stewart Gardner at the auction of Théophile Thoré-Bürger collection. Thoré-Bürger was a French art critic and journalist, who played a key role in the rediscovery of the works of Jan Vermeer in the 19th century.  [i]The Concert[/i] was one of the first Vermeer’s to be brought to the United States, and was exhibited in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso I d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, for his camerino d'alabastro ('chamber of alabaster') in the Castello Estense, Ferrara. It is one of the few mythological pictures by Bellini, who completed it in 1514. After his death soon afterwards (1516), Titian probably modified the landscape on the left to match it to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians (1518–1523), also in Alfonso's camerino. A more thorough reworking in about 1529 added more landscape, adding the mountain behind the figures.

The scene depicted conflates two episodes in Ovid's Fasti. Priapus, on the right, is attempting to seduce the sleeping nymph Lotis, but is prevented from success by the bray of Silenus' donkey. Around are the drunken Gods: Jupiter has an eagle next to him, Poseidon is caressing Cybele and Ceres, while Hermes is languidly lying on a barrel. The boy with vine-leaves on his head is an unusually young depiction of Bacchus. It is thought that Bellini initially painted the figures as mortals, following a misleading translation of Ovid (the so-called Ovidio volgarizzato), and had to re-paint them with the attributes of the Olympian gods.",1100,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/giovanni-bellini/the-feast-of-the-gods-1514.jpg,1002

Though the title of this painting is Adam et Eve (Adam and Eve), it was inspired by Orestes and Electra, a classical Greek sculpture in the Museum of Naples, which portrays Electra and her brother considering revenge on their mother and stepfather for the murder of their father, Agamemnon. Classical subjects such as this were popular in the interwar period, yet most artists attempted to give new life to Classicism by adapting it to modern times. Picabia refuses this temptation, instead leaving the statue enigmatically layered with a smiling face and leaving us with a mystery. This clash of imagery from apparently different sources would be a major inspiration for later artists such as Sigmar Polke.

At the heart of the controversy is the figure of the knight, and his symbolic function and meaning. Frequently, Dürer’s knight was interpreted as a symbol of moral virtue, an embodiment of the ideal of the ‘Christian Knight’. Following this interpretation the knight is a stoic figure, unfazed by the devil and the monsters that try to entice him. The knight is protected by his armor, and accompanied by his dog, a symbol of loyalty. Some have tied the conception of the engraving to the [i]Handbook of a Christian Knight[/i], written by the Dutch humanist, Erasmus of Rotterdam. It was also suggested that the knight could have been modeled after several historical figures, including Martin Luther, Pope Julius II and Franz von Sickingen, a German knight and important figure of the early period of the Reformation.

However, more recent studies challenge the interpretation of the ‘Christian Knight’, pointing out that it overlooks the social and political context of Dürer’s time. Historical documentation refers to the phenomena of Robber Knights, who attacked and louted dealers and merchants, threatening trade and finances of cities such as Nuremberg (Dürer’s place of birth and principal place of residence). Evidence of Dürer’s contempt for these figures may exist in an earlier artwork, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/death-and-the-landsknecht-1510][i]Death and Landsknecht[/i][/url] (1510). In the 1510 woodcut, Death confronts the indifferent Knight, who appears unconcerned by the ominous encounter. The woodcut is accompanied by a poem written by the artist, in which he warns those who do not pay their dues in this life. If indeed the knight in [i]Knight, Death and the Devil[/i] is a ‘Robber Knight’, the devil and death are not his adversaries, but rather his companions. In this case, the knight could be seen as passive or compliant. The contrary interpretations of the knight also impact the analysis of other details in the engraving, such as the foxtail attached to the tip of the knight’s lance. In the context of the ‘Christian Knight’ interpretation, the foxtail can be seen as a good luck charm. In contrast, according to the ‘Robber Knight’ analysis, the foxtail can symbolize the trickery and the cunning nature of the fox.   

Another focal element in the engraving is the Knight’s horse, which was conceived with impressive anatomical accuracy. It is proposed that the pose of the knight and horse was inspired by Italian equestrian statues, particularly by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio]Andrea del Verrochio[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio/equestrian-statue-of-bartolomeo-colleoni][i]Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni[/i][/url] (1480-1488), in Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice. Because of his travels to Venice, Dürer was certainly familiar with the statue. Likewise, parallels can be made with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci]Leonardo Da Vinci[/url]’s preparatory [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/study-for-the-sforza-monument-1489]drawings for the equestrian monument of Francesco Sforza[/url]. Another identified source of influence is Dürer’s contemporary, German Renaissance painter, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lucas-cranach-the-elder]Lucas Cranach the Elder[/url]. Cranach’s woodcut, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lucas-cranach-the-elder/knight-in-armor-riding-toward-the-right-1506][i]Knight in Armor Riding toward the Right[/i][/url] (1506), demonstrates similarities in the position of the horse, the gloomy figure of the knight and the elements in the backdrop, the castle on the hill. Therefore, Dürer seems to successfully adapt a variety of sources, the robust proportions of Italian equestrian statues together with northern influences, such as Cranach’s woodcut.",768,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/albrecht-durer/the-knight-death-and-the-devil-1513.jpg,994

This painting is an example of his striking use of light to create an ethereal mood. It is stark and efficient and conveys a sense of desolation, yet the lighting softens these characteristics.",1851,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/edward-hopper/early-sunday-morning.jpg,1067

It is currently housed in the Louvre, Paris.

The painting was commissioned by Napoleon's sister, Queen Caroline Murat of Naples. Ingres drew for inspiration upon such works as Dresden Venus by Giorgione, and Titian's Venus of Urbino, though the actual pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder is directly drawn from the 1809 Portrait of Madame Récamier by Jacques-Louis David. The small head, elongated limbs, and cool color scheme all reveal influences from Mannerists such as Parmigianino, whose Madonna with the Long Neck was also well known for its anatomical distortion.

This eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Ingres' contemporaries believed it marked Ingres' break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism. Ingres' critics viewed him as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, a critic remarked that the work had ""neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation"". This echoed the general view that Ingres had disregarded anatomical realism. Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant even light to tone down the volume. Ingres continued to be attacked for his work until the mid-1820s.

Stemming from the initial criticism the painting received, the figure in Grande Odalisque is thought to be drawn with ""two or three vertebrae too many."" Critics at the time believed the elongations to be errors on the part of Ingres, but recent studies show the elongations to have been deliberate. Measurements taken on the proportions of real women showed that Ingres's figure was drawn with a curvature of the spine and rotation of the pelvis impossible to replicate. It also showed the left arm of the odalisque is shorter than the right. The study concluded that the figure was longer by five instead of two or three vertebrae and that the excess affected the lengths of the pelvis and lower back instead of merely the lumbar region.

Given how the duty of concubines was merely to satisfy the carnal pleasures of the sultan, this elongation of her pelvic area may have been a symbolic distortion by Ingres. While this may represent sensuous feminine beauty, her gaze, on the other hand, has been said to ""[reflect] a complex psychological make-up"" or ""[betray] no feeling"". In addition, the distance between her gaze and her pelvic region may be a physical representation of the depth of thought and complex emotions of a woman's thoughts and feelings.",1920,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/00142/images/57726d7fedc2cb3880b48098/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres-la-grande-odalisque-1814.jpg!HD.jpg,1069

The painting shows a boy dressed in a 17th-century costume, an homage to the Flemish master [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Anthony van Dyck[/url]. The dress and gestures in [i]The Blue Boy[/i] echo van Dyck’s portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/charles-ii-as-child-1637][i]Charles II as a child[/i][/url] (1637), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/the-five-eldest-children-of-charles-i-1637][i]The Children of King Charles I of England[/i][/url] (1637) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/portrait-of-charles-ii-when-prince-of-wales][i]Charles II as Prince of Wales, in Armor[/i][/url] (c. 1637-1638). These types of portraits were usually not commissions, instead, they served as intellectual exercises that allowed portrait painters to experiment, to show off their painterly skills and mastery. Gainsborough demonstrates his artistry in his treatment of the brooding landscape in the background, and the satin fabric costume in which he experiments with the play of light and shadow on the garment.

It has been said that Gainsborough painted [i]The Blue Boy[/i] because of his rivalry with fellow portrait painter, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joshua-reynolds]Sir Joshua Reynolds[/url]. In his writings, Reynolds stated that cool colors should not dominate the foreground, rather they should be used in small amounts to set off the warm colors in the painting. However, this story was likely invented to play up the rivalry between the painters: [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was exhibited in 1770, and Reynolds made this remark in 1778. Still, it is worth noting that the two painters held opposed artistic beliefs: while Reynolds was very stern and advocated for the study of old masters, Gainsborough was more spontaneous and modern in his approach. 

Because he was the owner of the painting, it was widely believed that the sitter in the painting was Jonathan Buttall, the son of a wealthy hardware merchant. However, this identification was never confirmed and recently art historian Susan Sloman suggested the sitter could be Gainsborough Dupont, the artist’s nephew. Dupont lived with Gainsborough’s family in Bath and London and was the painter’s one and only resident apprentice and assistant. Gainsborough painted his nephew’s portrait in a similar costume on two other occasions: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/dupont][i]Gainsborough Dupont[/i][/url] (1770-1772) in the Tate collection and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/gainsborough-dupont-1773][i]Gainsborough Dupont[/i][/url] (1773) in the Rothschild collection. The two portraits of Dupont demonstrate a physical resemblance to the sitter in [i]The Blue Boy[/i]. In the Rothschild portrait, Dupont even wears a blue frock like the one worn by [i]The Blue Boy[/i]. Furthermore, x-rays of the painting show that originally Gainsborough painted a dog next to the boy. The dog, an English water spaniel was likely Tristram, one of the Gainsborough’s family pets, making it more likely that the artist was painting a family member.

The painting belonged to Jonathan Buttall until he filed for bankruptcy in 1796. From that point, it changed several owners: initially it was bought by politician John Nesbitt, later, in 1802, by painter John Hoppner, and in 1809, it entered the collection of Earl Grosvenor. During this period, [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was featured in multiple exhibitions: it became beloved by the public and was widely reproduced in print. In 1921, the iconic painting was sold to American railroad magnate Henry Edward Huntington for £182,200 – a record price at the time. The sale caused public outcry so before it was shipped to California, it was briefly displayed at The National Gallery. [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was seen by 90,000 people, and The National Gallery director Charles Holmes even made an emotional gesture by scrawling the words “Au Revoir, C.H” on the back of the canvas. Today, the painting is in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.",796,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/thomas-gainsborough/portrait-of-the-jonathan-buttall-1770.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

For Millet, the subject expressed profound personal and religious beliefs. However, his first version (now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) aroused a storm of controversy when it appeared in the 1850 Paris Salon. Viewers were shocked by Millet's heroic treatment of a lowly peasant at a time when the situation of the French rural poor was degrading, and socialism threatened bourgeois society. The latter version of this painting is now in the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; and lithographic version is in the MET, NY. 

Millet was the artist that van Gogh most revered.

A massive fire in Troy two years after Moses' birth clearly figured prominently in local lore. Moses cut out and saved a commemorative news clipping, published in 1939, and used it as the basis for a series of paintings. The artist's pencil notations on the clipping indicate how she proposed to modify the vignette. The Burning of Troy in 1862, the fifth version she did of the subject, is already quite far removed from the clipping.
Conventional illustration tends to focus on foreground or background, but seldom on both at once. Combining these two views was one hallmark of the ""Grandma Moses"" style.

It is the outstanding masterpiece of the Venetian Renaissance, the summit of Giorgione's creative career, so much so that according to some it may have been painted, or at least finished, by Titian rather than Giorgione.

The painting has been interpreted as an allegory of Nature, similar to Giorgione's Storm, which was undeniably painted by him; it was even viewed as the first example of the modern herdsman genre. Its message must be more complex than this. It is likely that the master consciously unified several themes in this painting, and the deciphering of symbols required a degree of erudition even at the time of its creation. During the eighteenth century the painting was known by the simple name of ""Pastorale"" and only subsequently was it given the title ""Fête champêtre"" or ""Concert champêtre"", owing to its festive mood. Modern research has pointed out that the composition is in fact an allegory of poetry.

The female figures in the foreground are probably the Muses of poetry, their nakedness reveals their divine being. The standing figure pouring water from a glass jar represents the superior tragic poetry, while the seated one holding a flute is the Muse of the less prestigious comedy or pastoral poetry. The well-dressed youth who is playing a lute is the poet of exalted lyricism, while the bareheaded one is an ordinary lyricist. The painter based this differentiation on Aristotle's ""Poetica"".

The scenery is characterized by a duality. Between the elegant, slim trees on the left, we see a multi-levelled villa, while on the right, in a lush grove, we see a shepherd playing a bagpipe. Yet the effect is completely unified. The very presence of the beautiful, mature Muses provides inspiration; the harmony of scenery and figures, colours and forms proclaims the close interrelationship between man and nature, poetry and music.",1184,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/pastoral-concert-fête-champêtre-1509(2).jpg,900

With Diaghilev, he produced elaborate costumes and designs for Cleopatra, Scheherazade, Carnaval, Narcisse, La Spectre de la Rose, and Daphnis et Chloe. Although he was Russian-born, due to his Jewish religion he could not obtain a residency card to live in St Petersburg. He was thus forced to live in the “pale of settlement,” in France, and completed all of these ballet productions between the years of 1909 and 1912.

The shimmer of the flames upon the water’s surface almost gives the painting a surreal quality by pulling the viewer into the inferno.

From modest origins, she worked young and carried out many activities before becoming familiar – she was then a model – with artists' studios, at a time when the space of women of her social condition was reduced to domestic interiors. His apprenticeship is made of sketches of everyday scenes, street workers, ordinary people, and his models are more often members of his entourage than professionals. The odalisque of The Blue Room takes up a pictorial cliché to reformulate it. The woman lying on the bed is not naked, but dressed, not in the oriental style like Matisse's odalisques, but like a modern woman. His shirt with suspenders, his striped pajamas not only evoke eroticism or sexual expectation but also the rest of a body in the comfort of loose and colorful clothes, which affirm a desire for modernity. The detail of the cigarette, ostensibly stuck in the mouth, then characterizes women of little virtue, like the gigolettes of Kupka or the women artists. This modernity is attached here to the representation of a mature woman, with thick hands, a weary and heavy body, with heavy breasts. According to Valadon, “you have to have the courage to look the model in the face if you want to reach the soul. Never bring me to paint a woman who is looking for the lovable or the pretty, I will disappoint her right away. The composition, which takes up the traditional scheme of the voluptuous nude framed by curtains, takes us into the bohemian intimacy of the studio saturated with intense blues. Lost in thought, the woman forgets the painter's intrusion: it's a stolen moment.

Other artists, usually motivated by the higher purposes of patriotism or pacifism, have shown the disasters of war, suppression, and martyrdom; torture and pain are often represented as the just deserts of sinners tumbling into hell, and the roasting and beheading of saints are depicted to serve the greater glory of God. But Beckmann sees no purpose in the suffering he shows; there is no glory for anybody, no compensation, no gloating over justice accomplished-only enseless pain, and cruelty for its own sake. Beckmann blames human nature as such, and there seems to be no physical escape from this overwhelming self-accusation. Victims and aggressors alike are cornered. There is no exit.

""And yet, strangely, the composition is visually satisfying: it is jointed as by a master carpenter. That is the cruelest aspect of this work; it presents utter orderliness, as if to say: This is the way things are supposed to be, this is ""regularity."" Not only the design, with its parallels and complementary angles, demonstrates this perverted ""law and order""; the colors, too, appear well spaced and thoughtfully distributed. The woman in the right foreground may be wearing a blue corset because the tongue of the strangled man in the upper left turned blue and the painter needed a color-equilibrium. The torturer's tie may be yellow in order to correspond to the yellow wax of the candles.

""Beckmann has abandoned the Christian symbolism he used in previous works. There is no salvation in sight. One may consider the tiny window cross in the darkness outside as a symbol of hope, but otherwise the pressure in the tight little torture chamber is without relief.

""This is one moment in one attic in Germany at the end of World War I. There is no past and no future. The phonograph blares in order to blot out the cries of anguish. Its tune emphasizes the newsreel actuality of this happening: this is the present, this is the world.

""The complex psychological situations are boiled down to simple formulas. The young woman performing an involuntary split is menaced by the candle. The woman on the right, nonchalantly swept off her feet, will be unable to prevent the rape. The monkey-like sadist in the middle accomplishes his torture with scientific coolness, as if to test the degree of pain that a human being can stand. Only the dog on the left considers outside help as a possibility: he directs his howling away from the center, believing that there is somebody, something outside the confines of the frame. But he is not rational, of course!

""The foreground shows, for the first time in Beckmann's oeuvre, the pair of candles which he later used again and again in still lifes and triptychs: one has fallen and given up its ghost; the other carries bravely on. It is as if the artist wanted to leave one glimmer of hope, one little flickering light to negate the whole of darkness.""

Martha Kearns, her biographer, points out that Kollwitz's series is remarkable for its portrayal of the working class taking action and suffering the consequences of their rebellion, with women playing active roles in the conflict. Significantly, Kollwitz's series begins with Misery, a print of a child's death from poverty, highlighting that her response to the weavers' revolt is rooted in the deprivations of poverty.

The Misery print is a somber depiction of hopelessness and grief. The focus of the print is the child's deathbed, where his sorrowful mother kneels beside him with her head in her hands. The child is tiny, almost skeletal, and surrounded by a heavenly bright light that contrasts with the room's gloom. This contrast highlights the child's innocence as a victim of poverty, a consequence of the oppressive working conditions that prevented survival. The room is dark, with only the light from the child illuminating it. A large loom dominates the scene, and the father, holding a sibling, looks down with downcast eyes, while the sibling gazes directly at the loom, symbolizing the source of the family's misery.

Kollwitz struggled with her lack of extensive etching training when she started the series. She initially used lithography to make the first three prints before switching to etchings, which she perfected with a combination of drypoint, acquatint, tusche wash, and soft ground processes. The series was unusual for combining different mediums. Kollwitz's work was displayed at the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1898, where it would have won the gold medal prize if Emperor Wilhelm II had not dismissed it as ""gutter art."" Nonetheless, Kollwitz went on to win the gold medal for the series the following year.",1157,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/kathe-kollwitz/not_detected_235963.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

It was part of a group of three painted by Titian between 1518 and 1525. The other two are [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/the-worship-of-venus-1518][i]Worship of Venus[/i][/url] (1518-1519) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/bacchus-and-ariadne-1523][i]Bacchus and Ariadne[/i][/url] (1520-1523). It stemmed from the Roman writer Philostratus, who left a collection of descriptions of pictures under the title ""Imagines."" One concerned the visit of Bacchus and his entourage of satyrs and bacchantes to the island of Andros. There, the natives were blessed by the presence of a river of wine. Upon the suggestion of his patron, Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, who wanted works to decorate his private [i]studiolo[/i], Titian reconstructed the classical narrative in this masterpiece.

The scene is set on the island of Andros, where the followers of Bacchus await his arrival in varying stages of inebriation, as they drink from the island's river of wine. Bacchus himself is not present, but his ship can be seen in the distance. Meantime, gods, men, and children celebrate the sublime effects of wine, whose consumption, according to Philostratus, makes men dominant, rich, generous to their friends, handsome and tall beyond their dreams. If Philostratus' description was sparse, this painting is riotously full of detail and incident, and only Titian could create, at the center of the scene, the brilliant and unforgettable emblem of this Bacchic setting. Silhouetted against the sky, a dancing youth holds a glass wine jug. He looks up, like an astronomer, at this sun and moon of his inebriated universe. A debate about balance and the horizontal is conducted by the clear vessel, tilted, and the equator of wine that it contains. Beneath such a heavenly body, the earth will be drunk and inspiring too.

With the coming of dawn on Andros, the river god, instead of adopting his canonical reclining position, remains a lie-a-bed in his mulch of vines (top-right). The wine-red stream has also left the nymph in the foreground - based on a classical statue of Ariadne - to her erotic slumbers, as undisturbed by the singing, dancing, and drinking that continue among the elaborately interwoven throng as by Apollo's call. Titian also deviated from the original text by creating two immigrants to Andros. They are the two courtly young women reclining in the center foreground amid a litter of overturned vessels of various sorts, indicating abandon. The girl in red has had her attentions to the nude youth (deriving from a figure in Michelangelo's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/sketch-of-a-nude-man-study-for-the-battle-of-cascina][i]Battle of Cascina[/i][/url]) interrupted by her companion. In contrast, he has been distracted by the dancer in ochre. Now, in close conversation, the girls do not engage directly with those about them as, with lingering gestures, they lay aside the shepherds' pipes, which, in more than one sense, they have been playing. Their tune, on the paper, is now taken up by the singers standing among the trees behind them. These music-makers are to be distinguished from the Andrians - fellow mortals - and from the spirits and deities that occupy the place. It may be understood that the immortals, and indeed the Andrians themselves, have been conjured up in the imagination by the girls, or else that - sensitive to the spirit of the scene and the effects of wine - they are rewarded by the attentions of beings who await the call of mortals' music and imagination.

Other figures also allude to classical statuary. The maenad (female follower of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine) dressed in white, is a reference to the sculpture of an antique torso in the Grimani collection, while the male nude pouring wine on the left appears to be a reworking of The Wounded Gaul, a work of Hellenistic art unearthed in Rome around 1515 and probably known to Titian through a drawing.

Titian called this type of picture a [i]poesie[/i]. It is the creation of the artist, and it addresses its audience as does a poem, allusively - inviting a meditation, a reverie, an engagement of sensibility, and never arriving at a definitive meaning.",1327,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/00142/images/titian/bacchanal.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Guggenheim Museum, New York City, NY, US']",[],"At the time Bonnard was painting this summer breakfast scene, Rockefeller Center stood half built and Europe was gearing itself for war. Yet the modern world seems all but ignored in Bonnard's painting, which harks back to the artistic tenets of the late 19th century, its vibrant colors conjuring up the canvases and theories of Paul Gauguin's circle. Around 1890, Bonnard belonged to the Nabis (from the Hebrew word for ""prophet""), a group that tended to paint mystical or occult scenes in order to invoke extraordinary psychic states. As this painting shows, Bonnard still lent a hallucinatory aura to the everyday some 40 years later.

Bonnard resolutely painted subjects such as those in Dining Room on the Garden (Grande salle à manger sur le jardin, 1934–35) for most of his life, being called très japonard (very Japanese-like) for his attempts to create a charged psychological moment in a virtually non-perspectival domestic space reminiscent of Japanese prints. This painting, one of more than 60 dining-room scenes he made between 1927 and 1947, is neither decorative (as these works have often been called) nor is its subject truly his first concern. Dining Room on the Garden sets out to capture the moment and the intrinsically ungraspable play of mood and light. On close inspection, the colored areas within the flattened picture plane lose their relation to the objects depicted: a chair melds into the window frame; the window echoes the painting's borders, becoming a view within a view; and Marthe, the painter's oft-depicted wife, merges passively into her surroundings. It is in his ability to create a timeless microcosm while laying bare the gesture of applying paint to canvas that Bonnard's modernism is revealed.",648,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/pierre-bonnard/dining-room-on-the-garden.jpg!Large.jpg,600

In the center of the canvas, a woman uses a hayfork while behind her others do similar work in a brightly lit field punctuated by haystacks.

Pissarro adopted the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pointillism]Pointillist[/url] technique in 1886, saying that ""[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neo-impressionism]Neo-Impressionism[/url] was the next phase in the logical march of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionism[/url]."" What set his work apart from the other Neo-Impressionists was his emphasis on rural life and labor. Pissarro's depiction of peasant life along with his own scientific explorations of color speaks to the anarchist theories he adopted in the latter half of the 1870s.

Pissarro felt that his scientific studies freed him from the Academy's strictures of how to see and depict reality. He also evoked the utopian visions of peasant societies he read about in the writings of anarchists Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Peter Kropotkin. Pissarro wanted ""to educate the public,"" by portraying the common man, but he also wanted to avoid idealizing and sentimentalizing his subjects.

He was able to overcome his challenge, however, to the benefit of his color palette, which he would take with him throughout the rest of his paintings. He learned to take a monochromatic scheme and vary the shades to beautiful complimentary tones. This particular view was also painted by Corot’s fellow artists Achille-Etna Michallon, who had been Corot’s teacher, and his friend Ernst Fries.

It is based on a photograph of the painter and his mother, taken in 1912 in his native country Armenia. Only three years later, the Ottoman Empire began the systematic extermination of the Armenian people, known as the Armenian Genocide. Even though Gorky and his family survived a death march, the ordeal caused permanent damage. His mother’s health particularly suffered, and in 1919, she died of malnourishment.

Gorky began working on the double portrait in 1926 and worked toward the final version over the next decade. During this period, Gorky made many [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artists-s-mother]preparatory sketches[/url] and studies. For example, two quick pen sketches drawn side by side were used to set up the composition and arrangement of the painting. In another pencil sketch, the artist created a detailed study for the painting by using a grid with numbered squares to enlarge the drawing. He also created another version of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artist-and-his-mother-1942][i]The Artist and His Mother[/i][/url] (ca.1926-1942) in a warmer color palette. Still, this version does not appear to be as sharp and precise in its painterly treatment and finishing touches.

In [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i], Gorky applied and scrapped thin layers to give the surface the soft glow of marble or porcelain. He painted stiff figures in cool and muted colors, blending patches of ochre, blue, green, and brown. The figure of the mother resembles a statue, due to the severe posture and the flat surface of the apron that looks like a smooth piece of marble or stone. In terms of style, [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i] was influenced by the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], especially the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-gertrude-stein-1906][i]Portrait of Gertrude Stein[/i][/url] (1906). In this painting and other portraits, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/portrait-of-vartoosh-1937][i]Portrait of Vartoosh[/i][/url] (1936-1937), the artist paid particular attention to the eyes. For Gorky, expressive eyes were characteristic Armenian features. As a child, he might have seen in his native village medieval religious paintings and manuscripts that highlighted these features. Later, while visiting American museums, Gorky discovered Russian icons, and the large eyes in Sumerian and Hittite art, which he associated with his ancestry in the Caucuses.

The horrible events that shaped Gorky’s early life and the traumatic loss of his mother come across in [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i]. When painting the scene, Gorky chose to leave parts unfinished. By erasing the two hands of his mother, he injected a sense of violence into the painting. The figures in Gorky’s art, especially his mother, seem to disintegrate in the same way that memories become more elusive with time. Gorky transformed the old photograph into introspection on his mind: on the canvas, he reconstructed the complex emotional response to the photograph. The statue-like figure of the mother, the hollow eyes, and the numb expression make her seem almost ghost-like. In comparison, the figure of the young boy has three dimensions and a distinctly sad expression. For Gorky, the painting was an expression of personal loss, and for many others, it became a symbol of the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide.",944,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/arshile-gorky/the-artist-with-his-mother-1936.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Caillebotte was an active member of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] movement, even though he painted in a more realistic style than other members of the group. The quick and loose brushwork of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Claude Monet[/url] or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir]Pierre-Auguste Renoir[/url] emphasized motion and the fleeting effects of light on the surface. In contrast, Caillebotte’s precise brushwork and crisp detail gave the impression of a frozen moment or a photographic snapshot. 

[i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] is a typical Impressionist subject, modern life in an urban setting, identified as the intersection between rue de Turin and rue de Moscou. The painting presents the urban transformation of Paris, that went through sweeping renovations of the city commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III and directed by his prefect of Seine, Baron Georges Haussmann. Caillebotte witnessed these vast transformations that were complete in 1870. [i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] shows the merging of the old and the new city: the couple and the male in the foreground walk on a narrow sidewalk that represents the old city, while a newly constructed building in the backdrop marks the emergence of the new city. The painting is populated by multiple characters placed in a zigzag pattern, which represent the range of social classes that form the urban landscape. Caillebotte most prominently featured the bourgeois class, represented by the elegant couple in the foreground. Different classes are represented to a lesser extent and can be identified by their attire and activity. For instance, a man in the background carrying a ladder is likely a worker. Similarly, the two figures passing each other in front of the second building on the left are wearing unfashionable tattered clothing that indicates their lower status.

Caillebotte exhibited the painting at the third Impressionist exhibition in 1877 together with another large street scene [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/le-pont-de-l-europe-1877][i]Le Pont de l’Europe[/i][/url] (1876). [i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] was bought by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1964, where experts have extensively studied the painting and its many [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/rue-de-paris-jour-de-pluie-etude-1877]preparatory sketches and studies[/url] to better understand Caillebotte’s artistic process. Research and experiments conducted by the Institute have presented compelling evidence that Caillebotte used the optical device [i]camera lucida[/i] for the preparatory sketches of the painting. The device would allow the artist to see the scene and the drawing surface at the same time, making it easier to determine an accurate perspective. Still, there is no documentation supporting the claim that Caillebotte ever used such a tool. Caillebotte, possibly, never discussed his methods because many proponents of Impressionism, including writer Émile Zola, criticized paintings that emulated the crispness and precision of a photograph as ‘anti-artistic’.

After the initial sketches which helped establish the essential spatial and architectural elements of the intersection, Caillebotte made character studies and even created a painted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/rue-de-paris-jour-de-pluie-etude-1877-0][i]Sketch for Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i][/url] (1877). In the sketch, he further developed the color palette and the placement of various figures. Caillebotte continued to make changes on the original canvas, like adding new characters, the two women walking away in the background. The ambitious painting represents the height of Caillebotte’s artistic achievement, as the artist would never again attempt a multi-figure composition on this scale.",1573,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/gustave-caillebotte/paris-a-rainy-day-1877.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Cézanne began to paint in the area around 1900, finding numerous motifs in the dense woods on the grounds of the estate, for example: Trees and Rocks in the Park of the Château Noir, c. 1904. The house, in its decrepit isolation, inspired some of the artist’s most foreboding images. The eerie structure seen in Château Noir, 1900–1904, seemingly in ruins, is half-hidden behind pines that, like the rocks of Bibémus, almost obstruct the sky. Cézanne’s saturated palette—dark greens, blues and ochers—makes the scene all the more powerful. The somber, enclosed spaces of the paintings of the Château Noir and the Bibémus quarry count among his most emotionally profound pictures and are indicative of a decided melancholy that pervades Cézanne’s work in his last decade.

[i]Snap the Whip[/i], one of Homer's most beloved works, evoked nostalgia for the nation's agrarian past as the population shifted to cities. Released from their lessons, the exuberant bare-footed boys engage in a spirited game of snap the whip, which required teamwork, strength, and calculation—all important skills for a reuniting country. Their clothing, more specifically their caps, suspenders, and short pants, reflects the true late 1800 American attire. 

Featured in the background is the familiar little red schoolhouse; the school teachers in the distance are most likely meant to be supervising the usual recess activity. The scenic landscape of trees and wildflowers bordering a small field is so realistic that the viewer can almost hear the chirping of the birds and the buzzing of the insects. The boys' bare feet signal childhood's freedom, but their suspenders are associated with manhood's responsibilities. Observed from right to left, Homer's boys hang on to one another, strain to stay connected, run in perfect harmony, and fall away, enacting all the possible scenarios for men after the Civil War.

Art historian Edward Lucie-Smith described in his text, American Realism, ""Childhood and the life of children took on a special significance in America in the years following the Civil War, and these images symbolized the will to rebuild and to make a stronger and more vigorous nation."" Subtle allusions to the lost generation of Civil War soldiers, the young widows left behind along with the hopes for the next generation provide the underlying narrative of these post-war works which focus on the lives of young teachers and their students.

An earlier, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/winslow-homer/snap-the-whip-1872-0]larger version of this subject (Butler Institute of American Art)[/url] was among the most celebrated paintings at the 1876 Centennial International Exhibition, held in Philadelphia—America's first world's fair. The Met's version differs from the original in its background, with a wide blue sky replacing a lush mountain range, making the image less regionally specific.

He was entranced by the light in the South of France, and created over 300 paintings during his stay along the Mediterranean coast.

The title, which Twombly scrawled in the lower right corner, refers to the Roman myth in which Jupiter, transformed into a swan, seduces Leda, who would later give birth to Helen of Troy. Rather than the conventional imagery of a graceful nude languidly entangled with a swan, Twombly merged diverse media, resulting in violent and forceful swirls, scratches and zig-zags flying out in all directions. Amidst the colliding, graffiti-like elements, he included recognizable hearts, a phallus, and a window-like rectangle, the latter read as a more stabilizing aspect of this otherwise explosive painting.",600,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/cy-twombly/leda-and-the-swan.jpg,571

During World War II, the city of San Sepolcro was supposed to be bombed, which would have destroyed the painting. But, the pilot of the bomber plane, Captain Clarke, who had read Aldous Huxley’s reports that The Resurrection was the greatest painting in the world, remembered that the painting was held in San Sepolcro. He ordered his men to stop the bombing, this saving the painting and the town from annihilation. After the fighting was over, it was determined that the Nazi soldiers had already left the area, and so the bombing wasn’t necessary. Captain Clarke was regarded as a hero, and the city of San Sepolcro named a street after him as a symbol of their gratitude.

There are several levels of action in The Thunderstorm. Fierce storm clouds arc rapidly approaching over the mountains, and in the distance the trees have already begun to whip wildly in the wind. The artist's deployment of color to represent these events is extraordinarily acute: The parched yellows of a late summer meadow, the varied greens of the trees, and the shifting colors of the sky before the advancing torrent are all keenly observed.

In the foreground, Moses presents the human reaction to the oncoming threat. There is a mad rush to get the hay into the barn and, at middle distance, a black horse bolts in terror.

The girl in the yellow dress is frozen in mid-run, while strangely, behind her to the left, two other children seem oblivious to the commotion. The abstract forms used to render all the human and animal activity stand in sharp contrast to the impressionistic interplay of colors in the landscape elements of the composition. This juxtaposition of abstraction and realism was one of the principal cornerstones of the ""Grandma Moses style.""",800,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/grandma-moses/the-thunderstorm-1948.jpg,659

In the background, a reproduction of Whistler's View of the Thames is visible on the wall. The Japanese-inspired floral pattern on the curtain hanging at left reflects the artist's interest in the Japanese aesthetic, with his signature butterfly symbol visible in the upper right corner.

Although the arrangement of forms may seem simple, there is a deliberate balance of shapes at play, with the rectangular shapes of the picture on the wall, the curtain, and the floor stabilizing the sitter's form. Anna McNeill Whistler, a deeply religious woman, posed for her son after a model cancelled, but due to her age, she was seated instead of standing.

When the painting was purchased by the French government in 1891, it became the first American work to receive this honor. This elevated Whistler's reputation and helped him secure wealthy American patrons. The painting has become iconic and is widely interpreted as a symbol of motherhood, mourning (due to the colors used), or American Puritan stoicism (because of the sitter's clothes). It has inspired other artists, including Albert Herter and Henry Ossawa Tanner, and has appeared in popular culture through movies, cartoons, and advertisements.",1600,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/james-mcneill-whistler/arrangement-in-grey-and-black-no-1-portrait-of-the-artist-s-mother-1871.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

In this painting, Whistler portrays a fireworks display in the night sky, conveying a sense of excitement and celebration. Rather than offering a clear image, the artist's sweeping brushstrokes of dark blues and greens, interrupted by small bursts of bright color, capture the effects of fireworks over the river, exemplifying the Aesthetic principle of ""art for art's sake."" Whistler described the painting as conveying a ""dreamy, pensive mood"" rather than a narrative.

Despite its significance as an early example of abstraction, The Falling Rocket was not initially well received. Critics questioned the value of the seemingly convoluted subject matter and criticized what they perceived as Whistler's reckless and careless painting technique. The negative review by John Ruskin prompted Whistler to sue for libel, submitting this painting, along with other nocturnes, as evidence. Ruskin's condemnation of Whistler's work as representative of ""the modern school"" proved accurate, as Whistler's technique of flicking paint at the canvas to create the fireworks influenced later modern artists, most notably Jackson Pollock.",902,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/james-mcneill-whistler/nocturne-in-black-and-gold-the-falling-rocket.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Despite Turner's title, no ship called Ariel is known to have been lost or involved in a storm in the years immediately preceding 1842, nor is any ship of that name known to have operated out of Harwich at this time. However, Charles Ninnis has suggested that Turner misremembered the name of the Fairy, which did set out from Harwich on 12 November 1840 and sank with all hands in a storm which began the following day and was still raging on 21 November, ‘the day on which the Princess Royal was born’, as the label on the back of No. 480 has it. Turner is not known to have been at Harwich at the time but could well have witnessed the storm at Margate where he often stayed with Mrs Booth.

In addition Adele Holcomb has cast doubts on the veracity of the story that Turner had himself tied to the mast for four hours during the storm; it does indeed bear a suspicious resemblance to accounts of the marine painter Joseph Vernet. However, in the fifth edition of his notes on the Turners on view at Marlborough House, Ruskin added a report of a conversation between the Rev. William Kingsley and Turner in which the artist stressed the truth of the incident and his interest in recording the experience: ‘I had taken my mother and a cousin to see Turner's pictures, and, as my mother knows nothing about art, I was taking her down the gallery to look at the large “Richmond Park”, but as we were passing the “Snowstorm” she stopped before it, and I could hardly get her to look at any other picture; she told me a great deal more about it than I had any notion of, though I have seen many sea storms. She had been in such a scene on the coast of Holland during the war. When, some time afterwards, I thanked Turner for his permission for her to see his pictures, I told him that he would not guess what had caught my mother's fancy, and then named the picture; and he then said, “I did not paint it to be understood, but I wished to show what such a scene was like; I got the sailors to lash me to the mast to observe it; I was lashed for four hours, and I did not expect to escape, but I felt bound to record it if I did. But no one had any business to like the picture.” “But,” said I, “my mother once went through just such a scene, and it brought it all back to her.” “Is your mother a painter?” “No.” “Then she ought to have been thinking of something else.” These were nearly his words; I observed at the time he used “record” and “painting” as the title “author” had struck me before’—see Turner's sub-title in the R.A. catalogue; Ruskin himself wrote ‘Note the significant use of this word, instead of “artist”’.

However, Ruskin records Turner's hurt reaction to the criticism (untraced) that the picture was nothing but a mass of ‘soapsuds and whitewash’: ‘Turner was passing the evening at my father's house on the day this criticism came out: and after dinner, sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, I heard him muttering to himself at intervals, “soapsuds and whitewash! What would they have? I wonder what they think the sea's like? I wish they'd been in it.”’ (Incidentally Frith, giving evidence at the Whistler versus Ruskin trial in 1878, attributed this criticism to Ruskin himself! See Ruskin, 1903–12, xxix, p. 584.) The Athenaeum's review on 14 May was typical of this abuse: ‘This gentleman has, on former occasions, chosen to paint with cream, or chocolate, yolk of egg, or currant jelly, —here he uses his whole array of kitchen stuff. Where the steam-boat is—where the harbour begins, or where it ends—which are the signals, and which the author in the Ariel...are matters past our finding out.’ Or, as the Art Union for 1 June observed, ‘Through the driving snow there are just perceptible portions of a steam-boat labouring on a rolling sea; but before any further account of the vessel can be given, it will be necessary to wait until the storm is cleared off a little. The sooner the better.’

In Modern Painters Ruskin described the Snowstorm, with two watercolours, as ‘nothing more than passages of the most hopeless, desolate, uncontrasted greys, and yet ... three of the very finest pieces of colour that have come from his hand’. Later, in a description of the effect of sea after prolonged storm he pointed out that ‘There is indeed no distinction left between air and sea; that no object, nor horizon, nor any land-mark or natural evidence of position is left ... Suppose the effect of the first sunbeam sent from above to show this annihilation to itself, and you have the sea picture of the Academy, 1842, the Snowstorm, one of the very grandest statements of sea-motion, mist, and light, that has ever been put on canvas, even by Turner. Of course it was not understood; his finest works never are...’ (Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll, The Paintings of J.M.W.

The painting is rich in symbolism and iconography, although there is a lack of consensus amongst critics about its meaning. Even the title of the painting may not be original, as it was not recorded until 1693. The composition of the picture contains elements found in the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione]Giorgione[/url], whose style had a significant influence on Titian at the beginning of his career.

The woman to the left is dressed in wedding attire and may represent carnal love and beauty. In contrast, the nude is usually read as spiritual love, a symbol of simplicity and purity. The position of Eros, at the center of the two, therefore, may indicate the point of mediation between spiritual and sexual desires.

The coat of arms on the trough belongs to the family of Niccolò Aurelio, who later became Grand Chancellor of Venice. In May of 1514, he married Laura Bagarotto, daughter of the jurist Bertuccio Bagarotto who had been executed some months before the wedding on charges of betraying the Serenissima Republic. The painting was probably commissioned to celebrate the marriage. It has been suggested that the relief design on the front of the trough symbolizes life and death, inviting the newlywed Laura, to overcome the sorrow for the loss of her father and flourish in marital love, both spiritual and physical. Alternative readings for this design include symbolism for the taming of passions or hidden literary references.",1920,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00129/images/titian/sacred-and-profane-love.jpg!HD.jpg,762

Cassatt was able to avid an over-sentimental portrayal of this intimate scene by using the aforementioned techniques, diving us a glimpse into the bath without dripping with sweet sentimentality.

As a supporter of Marxist politics, Kollwitz visited Liebknecht's home to offer condolences and made drawings of him at the request of his family. She began her image of Liebknecht as a lithograph but later completed it as her first woodcut print.

The woodcut print is a tribute to Liebknecht's ideas and actions and depicts him lying in state at his memorial, with mourners paying their respects. The composition plays with rigid horizontality and tilting arcs, with Liebknecht's body as a stiff, stone horizontal slab at the bottom center of the image. The mourners, mostly male workers of varying ages, occupy most of the composition and are arranged in a curved arc, with their heads and torsos bowed towards Liebknecht. The woman and child in the foreground symbolize future generations who benefit from Liebknecht's ideology, while the man's overemphasized hand prominently resting on Liebknecht's chest illustrates the physicality of the ideological fight.

Although the woodcut print was meant to honor Liebknecht, some members of the German Communist Party objected to Kollwitz's work because she was not an official member of the party, despite her commitment to radical politics.",1710,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/kathe-kollwitz/not_detected_235973.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

It is now considered the paradigm of the Russian avant-garde and an icon in all of Russian art. The painting made its debut at the 1919-1920 State Exhibition in Moscow, quickly establishing Malevich as one of the most influential artists of his era. It was sold at auction in 2008 for a record-setting $60 million, a record price for any Russian piece of art.

He did, however, have a long-time mistress, Margherita Luti, who was the daughter of a baker. X-ray analysis of the painting has revealed that the background of the painting was originally painted as a myrtle bush, which was considered a symbol of love and passion. According to Vasari, in his biography of Raphael, his death was brought on by a sudden illness, which was caused by a night of excessive sex with Luti. Being embarrassed and not disclosing this fact to his doctors, he subsequently received the wrong treatment and died two weeks later.

The subject of the painting originates from Jewish mythology:  Lilith was the first wife of Adam, and unlike Eve, she was created at the same time and from the same clay as Adam. In one version of the legend, Lilith betrayed Adam, after refusing to be his subordinate, and fled the Garden of Eden to join the fallen angel Samael. She is a demonic figure and seductress, known in folklore stories for killing babies and bewitching men.

In a letter from 1870 to his friend Dr. Hake, Rossetti wrote about the painting: ""[i]The picture… represents a Modern Lilith combing out her abundant golden hair and gazing on herself in the glass with complete self-absorption by whose fascination such natures draw others within their circle.[/i]"" Rossetti wrote the sonnet [i]Body's Beauty[/i] that accompanies the painting. In the sonnet, he describes Lilith the seductress, who entraps young men with the strains of her golden hair. Rossetti represents Lilith's dangerous nature through her luscious hair, as well as the paraphernalia surrounding her. The roses, a flower associated with Aphrodite, symbolize sensuality, while the poppies signify sleep and forgetfulness. On the dresser under the mirror is a spray of foxglove, which can be used as a medicine, but also as a deadly poison. The painting forms a pendant with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/sibylla-palmifera][i]Sibylla Palmifera[/i][/url] (ca. 1865-1870) that was accompanied by Rossetti's sonnet [i]Soul's Beauty[/i]. The two figures embody contrasting ideas: Lilith represents bodily sin and vice, while Sibylla signifies the ideal of female virtue.

Scholars have suggested that Lady Lilith was inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]'s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/vanitas-1515][i]Woman with a Mirror[/i][/url] (1515). Rossetti saw the painting during his trip to Paris in 1864, where he spent his time exploring the Louvre's collection. The two paintings share several pictorial elements: Rossetti emulated Titian's treatment of the female's flesh, as well as the central parting and the wavy curls of the cascading hair. Additionally, Rossetti referred to [i]Lady Lilith[/i] as a 'toilette painting,' reinforcing the assumption that Titian's work influenced him. The painting is also linked to the portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/portrait-of-jo-the-beautiful-irish-girl-1865][i]Jo, the Beautiful Irish Girl[/i][/url] (1865) by French Realist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Gustave Courbet[/url]. It is possible that Courbet was inspired by Rossetti, who visited his studio during his stay in Paris in 1864.  

Rossetti worked on the painting for several years and created at least four related drawings of the composition, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/study-for-lady-lilith-1866][i]Study for Lady Lilith[/i][/url] (1886), as well as watercolor replicas like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/lady-lilith-1867][i]Lady Lilith[/i][/url] (1867). The model in the preparatory drawings, watercolors, and the original oil painting is Fanny Cornforth, Rossetti's housekeeper, and mistress. The painting was commissioned by Rossetti's patron Frederick Leyland, who received the picture in the spring of 1869. However, in 1872 Leyland asked Rossetti for a significant alteration: he wanted to substitute Cornforth's face with that of Alexa Wilding, who Leyland felt had more 'refined' features. It remains unclear whether Rossetti agreed with Leyland's assessment and whether he was ultimately pleased with the outcome.",1036,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/00391/images/dante-gabriel-rossetti/lady-lilith.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

According to Greek and Roman mythology, Proserpine was the beautiful daughter of Ceres, the goddess of agriculture. She was abducted by the ruler of the Underworld, Pluto, who brought her to his realm to marry her. Ceres pleaded with Jupiter, the king of gods, for Proserpine's return, and Jupiter agreed under the condition that she had not consumed any of the fruits of the Underworld. However, Proserpine ate six grains of pomegranate, thus she was forced to accept her new role and destiny: her punishment was to spend six months of the year on earth, and six months in the Underworld. In Rossetti's painting, Proserpine is in a gloomy corridor of her palace; she seems pensive and sullen while holding a pomegranate, a symbol of her captivity. Next to her is an incense burner, the attribute of a goddess.

Rossetti, both a poet and a painter, often paired the two arts by creating accompanying poems for his paintings. For [i]Proserpine[/i], Rossetti wrote a sonnet and inscribed it in Italian on the picture and in English on the frame:

Afar away the light that brings cold cheer
Unto this wall, - one instant and no more
Admitted at my distant palace-door.
Afar the flowers of Enna from this drear
Dire fruit, which, tasted once, must thrall me here.
Afar those skies from this Tartarean grey
That chills me: and afar, how far away,
The nights that shall be from the days that were.
Afar from mine own self I seem, and wing
Strange ways in thought, and listen for a sign:
And still some heart unto some soul doth pine,
(Whose sounds mine inner sense in fain to bring,
Continually together murmuring,) -
""Woe's me for thee, unhappy Proserpine!""

The sonnet plays a complementary role, revealing to the viewer the symbolic meaning of the figure in the painting. Through the poem, Rossetti not only draws attention to the myth of Proserpine but also reveals to the viewer the inner thoughts behind her silent expression. 

The model in the painting is Jane Morris, the wife of artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-morris]William Morris[/url]. Jane was one of Rossetti's favorite muses, who embodied the ideal of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood]Pre-Raphaelite[/url] beauty. She modeled for many of Rossetti's paintings, including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-day-dream-1880][i]The Day Dream[/i][/url] (1880) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-pia-of-tolomei-1880][i]Pia de' Tolomei[/i][/url] (c.1868). The two also had a romantic relationship, that spanned in various degrees over nearly two decades, until Rossetti died in 1882.

Rossetti painted [i]Proserpine[/i] while staying with the couple at Kelmscott. Many have drawn a connection between the myth of Proserpine and the personal life of Jane Morris. By all accounts, Jane was in an unhappy marriage, which was further complicated by her work and relationship with Rossetti.  The artist probably viewed Jane as Proserpine, another beauty trapped in a sad situation, unable to free herself from her destiny. 
Rossetti often created replicas of his paintings, and Proserpine is one of the most famous examples. A total of eight oil versions were created, this was the seventh, and it was painted for Rossetti's patron, Frederick Leyland. The picture replaced an earlier version that was damaged in transit. Today, Proserpine is part of the collection of Tate Britain, London.",528,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/dante-gabriel-rossetti/proserpine-1874.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

So great was the damage that the idea of demolishing the old [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/gothic-art]Gothic[/url] building and replacing it with a new one was seriously considered. After considerable discussion, it was, however, decided to restore the areas affected and to replace the interior decoration. Among the damaged rooms was one of the most celebrated: the Sala del Maggior Consiglio. This large space, whose proportions make it one of the most majestic and imposing in the entire building, was the room where the Great Council met. In the 16th century, the Venetian senators who formed the Council numbered more than 1, 000. The room was used for purposes of legislation and for electing members of the magistracy.

It was decided to restore the room with a flat ceiling divided into sections with decorative, high-relief molding into which paintings would be fitted. The same concept was to be used for the frieze that ran along the two long side walls of the room in which painted portraits of the Doges would be inset. The subject selected to decorate the walls of the room was the Glorification of Venice, depicted through a series of military episodes. Three huge canvases would provide the principal elements in the ceiling. They are a central, rectangular one by Jacopo Tintoretto, depicting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tintoretto/doge-nicol%C3%B2-da-ponte-receiving-a-laurel-crown-from-venice-1584][i]The City of Venice offering a laurel Wreath to Doge Nicolò da Ponte[/i][/url] (1584) and two flanking, oval ones in which [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese]Veronese[/url] painted an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/apotheosis-of-venice-1585][i]Allegory of Venice[/i][/url] (1585), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/palma-il-giovane]Palma Giovane[/url] depicted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/palma-il-giovane/venice-crowned-by-victory-1584][i]Venice, crowned by Victory, receiving the conquered Provinces[/i][/url] (1584).

To replace the medieval fresco of around 1365 by Guariento, which had been damaged in the fire, the commission entrusted with devising and overseeing the new decoration organized a competition that may have been convened in 1582. The theme of this new image was the ""Glory of the blessed in Paradise."" Among the painters who took part were Francesco Bassano, Veronese, Palma Giovane, and Tintoretto. The commission gave the project to Veronese and Francesco Bassano, two artists with widely differing styles. However, Veronese's death in 1588 and the fact that Bassano had not started his part by the time of Veronese's death resulted in the project being given to Tintoretto, who was seventy years old by this date.

According to the guidelines established for the competition, the composition had to focus on the Coronation of the Virgin, inspired by Dante's [i]Paradise[/i]. Tintoretto included the blessed and different religious hierarchies among clouds, angels, and cherubim. The principal motif is the Coronation of the Virgin in the upper center, while the Dove of the Holy Spirit forms the axis of this complex composition. The main group, in which Christ leans forward and extends his hand to crown his mother, emerges between numerous heads and figures against the intense yellow of a cloud of glory. The remaining figures in the canvas are arranged in gently curving lines, floating among clouds and stars. Tintoretto has woven in the traditional iconography of the Annunciation scene, where the angel Gabriel announces that Mary will carry the child of God, together with the Last Judgment, implied by the artist with the symbol of the scales. The clouds wrap around the central figures, almost likes ripples in a pond, suggesting the continued reverberations of the church's teachings - especially significant during the time of the Counter-Reformation.

Seen from afar, [i]Paradiso[/i] is nearly an abstract vision composed of rhythmic patterns of light and color. The work represents the culmination of the artist's mastery of sharp contrasts between light and dark in the intensely rendered figures. The dramatic, almost theatrical quality of Tintoretto's scene would lay the foundation for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] art.",1290,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/tintoretto/paradise.jpg,750

The humanoid figure runs through the canvas, evincing a mood of panic and fear. A bloodied sword of violence stands upright in the background. At this time in Malevich’s career, he was being persecuted by the Soviet government, and as such this painting is more than a representation of a social wrong, it was a personal condemnation of the violence that had been done to him.

As early as 1827 he conceived a cycle of paintings that would illustrate the rise and fall of a civilization, and a few years later he began sketching and developing his ideas. 

[i]The Consummation of Empire[/i] is one of a sequence of five paintings entitled [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-cole/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-course-of-empire,resultType:masonry][i]The Course of Empire[/i][/url] commissioned by Cole's patron Luman Reed, created between 1833 and 1836. Each painting in the series depicts the same landscape at a different stage of the rise and fall of an imaginary civilization. This middle painting in the series represents the apparent triumph of that civilization, a scene crammed with classical porticos, rotundas, and statuary, with a happy, colorful procession of citizens passing over the bridge in the center. A statue of Minerva, goddess of wisdom, stands to the right but seems to be ignored by the hordes beneath.

The whole series was intended to serve as a warning about the over-weaning ambitions of Empire. Even this depiction of Empire at the height of its power anticipates its demise in the representation of a militaristic ruler carried aloft by the citizens. Later paintings in the sequence show the ruin of the city, and its eventual reclamation by nature, which in this image seems entirely subdued (as represented by the potted plant in the foreground). Anxious to create an epic series of paintings, and inspired by the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neoclassicism]Neoclassical[/url] masterpieces he had seen firsthand during his travels in Europe in 1829-1832, Cole nonetheless showed his unique ability through [i]The Course of Empire[/i] to capture the American spirit in his work. These paintings sound a note of both triumph - America had recently liberated itself from the British Empire - and caution: that the new state should not fall into the same traps as its European predecessors. More than that, the series seems to express Cole's anxiety about the encroaching threat of industry and urban expansion to the American landscape.

Thomas Cole’s importance and influence as an American artist exploded during the mid-1830s and his career flourished in the early 1840s. He deeply influenced his immediate peers and successive generations of American artists. He transformed the landscape genre from a reflective art to a medium of expressing historical, social, and political theory. By producing titanic icons of classical liberal, romantic, [i]locofoco[/i] historical and social theory, Thomas Cole stands as one of the most influential fine artists in the history of liberal thought.",1600,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/00340/images/thomas-cole/the-course-of-empire-the-consummation-of-the-empiree.jpg,1079

Despite his urban success, he never lost his love of the countryside and coastline, lamenting, ""I'm sick of portraits and wish very much to ... walk off to some sweet village, where I can paint Landskips.""

Gainsborough's landscapes, however, are seldom if ever of actual scenery. In accordance with much eighteenth-century art theory, he believed that nature itself was an unsuitable subject. Only after an artist had refined a scene through his sensibilities could he begin to paint it.

In the 1780s, Gainsborough experimented with a ""peep-show box."" Using translucent paints, he created landscapes on sheets of glass that were then inserted into a shadow box. Backlit with candles, the miniature theatre permitted endless lighting schemes by means of changeable screens of colored silk. Depicting an imaginary seacoast, this canvas reveals the influence of Gainsborough's viewing box. Framed by the dark beach and pale cliff, the sky and surf seem phosphorescent.

As usual, Gainsborough improvised as he worked. The boulder in the lower-right corner conceals two fishermen and an anchor that he later painted out.",1529,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/thomas-gainsborough/seashore-with-fishermen-1781(1).jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Richter cropped the image, isolating her lips and mouth. The choice of Bardot was not coincidental: at the time, she was one of the most prominent sex symbols from Europe. Her public image exemplified the connection between sex and mass culture, specifically the commodification of sex in capitalist societies. Thus, by isolating Bardot’s famous sensual lips in [i]Mouth[/i], Richter created an image that is both playful and disturbing. The painting also has a surrealist quality: the blurred lips and mouth are dismembered and detached from the face and body. A few years later, Richter also used another image of Bardot in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/mother-and-daughter-b-1965][i]Mother and Daughter[/i][/url] (1965). Bardot’s appeal was not only limited to Richter’s works, but her iconic image was also captured by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol]Andy Warhol[/url] in eight [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol/brigitte-bardot-1974]colorful paintings[/url] created in 1974.

[i]Mouth[/i] and [i]Mother and Daughter[/i] were examples of Richter’s early photo-paintings, whose sources were photographs collected by the artist. In 1962, Richter began collecting snapshots, postcards, newspaper cutting, and sketches. A few years later, Richter began to arrange the different images on loose sheets of paper, and at present, there are over 800 sheets. Over time, the collection became an art project in its own right called [i]Atlas[/i], which mixed collected images with personal photographs, and photographs taken by Richter himself. The collection offers significant insight into Richter’s artistic practice, and also reflects the different phases in his life.

[i]Mouth[/i] was featured in one of Richter’s first public exhibitions, [i]Living with Pop: A Demonstration for Capitalist Realism[/i] in Düsseldorf. The 1963 exhibition was a performance event staged in a furniture shop, where the artists exhibited their paintings in the shop setting. The exhibition was conceived and organized by Richter and his contemporaries, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/manfred-kuttner]Manfred Kuttner[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/konrad-lueg]Konrad Lueg[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke]Sigmar Polke[/url], that used the term ‘[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/capitalist-realism]Capitalist Realism[/url]’ to describe their art. Capitalist Realism is at times thought of as German [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] because of its shared characteristics with Pop Art, namely the interest in mass media, consumerism, and the banality of daily life. Through humor and irony, the artists expressed their unique political situation of living in a divided Germany during the Cold War. The name, Capitalist Realism, served as a parallel to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/socialist-realism]Socialist Realism[/url] (the dominant style in the Eastern German bloc) since both were essentially art forms created for the masses. 

By late 1963, Richter no longer distorted his source photographs in the extreme manner visible in [i]Mouth[/i]. He even destroyed several of his earlier paintings executed in this style. Perhaps, Richter would have also destroyed [i]Mouth[/i], but he already gave it to his fellow artist, Manfred Kuttner. In a 1993 interview, Richter expressed dislike for the painting, specifically its Pop Art style and the isolation and deformation of the face and mouth. However, he also stated that the painting was a representative example of his early work and the beginning of Pop Art.",400,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/gerhard-richter/mund-mouth-brigitte-bardot-s-lips-1963.jpg,358

Reynolds was an avid theater enthusiast, and his connections in the industry helped him expand his clientele. Garrick was a close friend of Reynolds, and the image represents his dual identity as an actor caught between the two genres. This theme of duality was frequently employed by Reynolds, as seen in works like Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse, where the figures of Terror and Fear lurk in the shadows.

The clothing and postures of the women signify their respective roles, demonstrating Reynolds' penchant for using symbolism in his portraits. However, the painting also carries a broader allusion, drawing a comparison between Garrick's theatrical choice and that of Hercules in classical mythology. Hercules had to choose between Virtue and Vice, often depicted as allegorical figures in works of the time. Reynolds' comparison of Garrick with Hercules serves as a humorous commentary on 18th century concepts of heroism. While many appreciated this lighthearted approach, some, including the American-British artist Benjamin West, found it irreverent and disrespectful to classical art traditions.",1000,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/00375/images/joshua-reynolds/59184fbb667671ad0740f6606b75d5f9.png,770

The flat land on top of the hill where they stand evokes Tuscany, as does the winding valley to the left. Meanwhile the skyline on the right, dominated by the basilica, could almost be the outskirts of Piero's home town Borgo Sansepolcro. The painting shows the impact of Northern European painting. Piero painted with tempera early in his career, but for later works like this one he began working in oil. Along with the use of brown under-painting for the figures, this shows a familiarity with Netherlandish and Flemish work. This is reinforced by the slim figure of Christ, who lacks the square muscularity of contemporary depictions from Italy, and is more reminiscent of paintings by artists like Hugo van der Goes. Piero has also experimented with perspective. It is the only one of his works that shows a building askew from the rest of the composition: this is the simple shed, which reminds the viewer of Christ's humble beginnings. It is possible that this panel was never completed. It has certainly been damaged, possibly by the work of a 19th-century restorer. Nevertheless, the painting holds more than enough detail to give a sense of a complete composition, one which is likely to have been among the last the artist created.",1024,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/piero-della-francesca/nativity-1475(2).jpg,884

He wrote to her that ""I would not be without your portrait for the world. The sight of it soon calms my spirit under all trouble, and it is always the first thing I see in the morning and the last at night."" The portrait was deemed an excellent likeness, with the fine and detailed finish of Maria's face contrasting with the looser brushstrokes comprising the background and her blouse.

Despite painting over 100 portraits in his career, most were executed out of financial necessity rather than an inherent interest in the genre. Nevertheless, many are refreshingly candid in their depictions, and there is a palpable sense of character and personality in the images he created. Constable did not compromise unique features to conform to contemporary beauty standards. This particular portrait exhibits a special sensitivity and warmth, which can be attributed to his close relationship with the sitter.

This portrait shares similarities with many of his other works in terms of the use of similarly colored, neutral backgrounds, and the composition of the sitters. Constable's portrayal of faces was always painstakingly detailed, but his approach to the sitter's garments varied depending on his relationship with the subject. Some clothing was rendered meticulously, while others were suggested through much looser brushwork, as seen in this portrait. This variance can be attributed to the commission basis of his work, where paintings for patrons were expected to be more highly finished.",474,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/00381/images/john-constable/14666b1521c76c48d88dbdc59376ae5e.jpg,579

Flowers of the Universal Flowering was created during this period, in which Filonov’s paintings were encrypted in such a way as to be completely non-representational to the viewer. His intent was to make the objects intermingle, or flower, within one another and become something entirely different, in an effort to make the invisible world of the soul visible on the canvas.

All of the seven paintings remain except for “Penance,” which was destroyed in a fire at the Rutland Belvoir Castle in 1816. “Baptism” was sold to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC in 1939.

The pictured attack had occurred some 30 years earlier. Watson, an orphan, had unwisely decided to take a dip from a skiff while the ship on which he was crewing docked in Havana Harbor. A shark attacked him, biting his right leg and pulling him under.The boy surfaced briefly before the shark dragged him under a second time, severing his right foot.

The painting, completed during the early part of Morisot's career, is the first example of her exploration of motherhood as a recurring subject, which was limited by the social norms of the era that restricted women's public activities without a chaperone. Although critics praised the painting when it was exhibited at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874, Morisot failed to sell it and decided to keep it within her family.

Morisot's composition is based on two interconnected triangles: one framing Edma's body and the other, slightly taller, framing the veil around the cradle, creating a harmonious balance and a subtle connection between the mother and child. Edma is shown drawing the translucent curtain around the cradle, emphasizing the intimacy of their relationship and shielding her daughter from the viewer's gaze. The close framing of the scene, eliminating the edges of the cradle, evokes the medium of photography, which the Impressionists were known for exploring. However, Edma's expression is difficult to interpret since she has no direct connection with her sleeping daughter, who appears with closed eyes. Some scholars suggest that Edma, who painted extensively before marrying a naval officer in 1864, appears wistful, yearning for the creative freedom she had before settling into the role of motherhood. Thus, while the veil hides her daughter's form, Edma's emotions remain ambiguous and unknown.",701,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/00452/images/berthe-morisot/1872le-berceau-the-cradle-1872-2.jpg,850

The subject of the huge canvas is the miraculous appearance of St Mark to rescue one of his devotees, a servant of a knight of Provence, who had been condemned to having his legs broken and his eyes put out for worshipping the relics of St Mark against his master's will. The scene takes place on a kind of proscenium which seems to force the action out of the painting towards the spectator who is thus involved in the amazement of the crowd standing in a semi-circle around the protagonists: the fore-shortened figure of the slave lying on the ground, the dumbfounded executioner holding aloft the broken implements of torture, the knight of Provence starting up from his seat out of the shadow into the light. In contrast, the figure of St Mark swoops down from above.

The overall composition of [i]The Miracle of the Slave[/i], although set within an opulent Roman courtyard, is intense with action. Three times the executioner attempted to levy the punishment, and each time the tools have broken before the slave could be harmed. This is the work of Saint Mark, who, in dramatic fashion, descends from heaven in a red robe and billowing orange cape to rescue the slave and spare him the suffering associated with this painful death. This miracle also converts the slave's master at embracing the Christian faith.

The great influence that [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url] had on Tintoretto's artistic style is visible in this work; the robust, muscular figures staged in a variety of complex positions are reminiscent of the Renaissance master. Scholars doubt whether Tintoretto made studies from the sculptural maquettes or other works based on the originals by Michelangelo.

Despite some of the initial criticism Tintoretto received for the speed at which he worked, made evident from the loose and gestural brushwork, this painting had a profound impact on Tintoretto's career. A commission for the Confraternity of Scuola Grande di San Marco brought the artist wide attention, after which he began receiving many commissions. According to Tintoretto's biographers, some members of the confraternity argued against accepting it, enraging the artist, who took it back to his studio. But eventually, the naysayers were discomfited, Tintoretto and his proponents won the day, and the painting was installed to great acclaim. The acceptance of this work was an essential step towards broadening the stylistic range of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/venetian-school]Venetian School[/url]. In addition to the more traditional approaches of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url], here, Tintoretto provided a highly dramatic presentation of a religious subject, which helped to lay the foundation for the future development of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] art.",1024,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00383/images/tintoretto/8618528210-74be591bf3-b.jpg,751

In the background, a battle scene suggests that retreat is underway. The officer is a real-life figure, Alexandre Dieudonné, who was a friend of the artist. He is depicted twisting backward, sword ready, in a dramatically contorted pose.

Military figures were among the artist's favorite themes, with this being one of his earliest and yet most important examples. The work also utilizes another favored subject of the artist, the horse, which he returned to throughout his career. The scene Géricault chose to depict is not a moment of military victory, as was commonly represented by the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neoclassicism]Neoclassical[/url] artists of the period. Everything in the narrative implies that the battle is about to be lost. The officer seems to look back in sad resignation. Instead of an idealized scene created using Ancient Roman or Greek motifs, as was common in the French Neoclassical style, Géricault chose to depict a romanticized scene full of drama. The tension is enhanced by bold color choices and varied light effects. His depiction reinforces the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] idea of the hero who, rather than seen triumphing, is shown struggling, brooding, or sad in the face of uncertain fate.

The choice of the subject could be seen as slightly ironic, given that his father had found a way to get him out of military service. Perhaps the work was an attempt to give visual form to the military drama that Géricault so admired but had not yet seen first hand. Whatever the work's motivations, it helped to launch Géricault's career and was well-received when it was exhibited at the 1812 Paris Salon.",920,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/00142/images/theodore-gericault/officer-of-the-chasseurs-charging-on-horseback.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The two human figures are derived from Italian Venus motifs. It is not certain whether the brothers encountered these motifs during their travels in Italy, or in one of the many sketchbooks that made the rounds throughout Europe during the Middle Ages. The graceful posture, also known as the S-posture is characteristic of the period, and today is usually referred to as 'International Gothic'. The painting depicts two people - a young woman with blond hair and a young man with dark hair. The purpose of this picture is to show which constellations influence the various parts or organs of the body. It is a veritable crash course in medical astrology. The texts in the four corners connect the constellations with the four humours that determine human character as well as the four heavenly wind directions and the two genders (male/female).",924,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/limbourg-brothers/anatomical-man.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Rossetti’s fascination with Dante began in the mid-1840s. A few years later, Rossetti translated [i]La Vita Nouva[/i], which appeared in 1864 as part of his publication [i]The Early Italian Poets[/i]. Before painting [i]Beata Beatrix[/i], Rossetti already created numerous illustrations inspired by Dante’s poem, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-meeting-of-dante-and-beatrice-in-paradise-1854][i]The Meeting of Dante and Beatrice in Paradise[/i][/url] (c.1854) and Dante`s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/dante-s-vision-of-rachel-and-leah-1855][i]Vision of Rachel and Leah[/i][/url] (c.1855).

In [i]Beata Beatrix[/i], the artist created a parallel between the Italian poet Dante’s sorrow at the death of his beloved Beatrice, and his own biography, the death of his wife Elizabeth Siddal in 1862. Siddal died of an overdose of laudanum, and her death was most likely a suicide. Rossetti painted Siddal as Beatrice: he depicted her not in the moment of death, but in a state that he described as a “[i]sudden spiritual transfiguration[/i].” The portrait of Beatrice has a mystical and transcendental quality: she is pale and ghostly, but also sensual and ethereal. The red dove acts like a messenger, bringing her a poppy flower, an instrument of death. Unlike the white dove, a symbol of purity, the red dove can be interpreted as a symbol of passion. The poppy holds several meanings: it is a symbol of passion, but also sleep and death. The flower is also a reference to Siddal’s overdose from laudanum, a drug that contains opium, which is made from the poppy flower.

The backdrop represents the city of Florence, the setting of Dante’s story, and the bridge refers to Ponte Vecchio, a landmark of the city. In one of his letters, Rossetti discussed the role of the city in the painting: “[i]You will remember how much Dante dwells on the desolation of the city in connection with the incident of her death, and for his reason, I have introduced it, as my background, and made the figure of Dante and love passing through the street and gazing ominously on one another, conscious of the event[/i]”. The figure of Love is portrayed as an angel holding in her hand a flickering flame signifying Beatrice’s life. The frame designed by Rossetti also references the city of Florence. He includes the date of Beatrice’s death and a phrase from [i]Lamentations 1:1[/i] that Dante quotes in [i]La Vita Nuova[/i]: ‘[i]Quomodo sedet sola civitas[/i]’ which means  ‘how lonely the city stands’, referring to the mourning of Beatrice throughout Florence.

Generally, [i]Beata Beatrix[/i] is understood as a commemorative painting, the artist’s expression of grief, and a tribute to his late wife. Rossetti worked on the oil painting for several years after Siddal’s death, but he had created other renditions of the artwork before Siddal’s death. Throughout his career, Rossetti often created several versions or replicas of his paintings. [i]Beata Beatrix[/i] was the first oil version of the image, and in 1889, it became a part of the Tate Britain collection. Although reluctant at first, Rossetti painted a second oil version for his patron William Graham, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/beata-beatrix-1872][i]Beata Beatrix[/i][/url] (c.1872), which is now part of the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. For this version, Rossetti added a predella – a painted panel at the bottom of the frame, which depicts the reunion of Beatrice and Dante in paradise. The additional frame provides a happy ending to the medieval love story, and perhaps reflects Rossetti’s new outlook on his grief.",811,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/dante-gabriel-rossetti/beata-beatrix-1880.jpg,1046

This is due to disputes that arose after Caravaggio's death regarding the attribution of the piece as a work of the great master. The painting was discovered in Argentina; it is now in a private collection in Munich. The reasons for thinking it may be by Caravaggio, apart from the style and subject matter, are as follows: in July 1610, following news of Caravaggio's death, the bishop of Caserta wrote to Cardinal Scipione Borghese that three paintings by the artist were in the Naples palazzo of the Marchesa of Caravaggio. They were two Saint Johns and a Magdalene. The paintings had been intended for Borghese and he instructed the Marchesa to look after them for him. Unfortunately for Borghese they were seized two days later by the head of the Knights of Malta in Naples, on the grounds that Caravaggio was a knight of the Order and all his possessions devolved on the Knights - which all involved must have known to be untrue, as Caravaggio had been expelled from the Order in 1608. The newly arrived Spanish Viceroy of Naples heard of the affair, but, believing the paintings were in Porto Ercole, wrote to the head of the Spanish garrison there telling him that the Knights had no right to them and that they should be returned to the Viceroy, ""in particular the painting of John the Baptist."" There is no certain knowledge of what happened to the various paintings after that point. Cardinal Borghese got the “Youth with a Ram”, but more than a year later. The other two paintings - the Magdalene and the second Baptist - disappeared, but it is possible, though unproven, that the Viceroy may have managed to secure the other Baptist. He would presumably have taken it back to Spain, and from there it could have made its way to South America. All this, however, is speculation - it needs to be pointed out that no-one knows the exact identity of the paintings involved.",956,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/caravaggio/john-the-baptist-1610(2).jpg,640

If both his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/abstract-expressionism]Abstract Expressionist[/url] paintings and his [i]Ocean Park[/i] represent aerial landscapes, the former are intuitive and impulsive, while the latter are coldly delineated and rational spaces. A comparison of the two shows just how far Diebenkorn's abstract vocabulary had evolved throughout his career. The painting marks a sharp contrast with the organic forms of his Abstract Expressionist work of the 1950s, showing a much more geometric and planned approach. This painting also shows his appreciation for the teachings of modernism and, in this case, the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian]Piet Mondrian[/url] specifically.

Here, Diebenkorn worked within Mondrian's conceptual grid framework and applied lighter washes of predominantly pastel colors to his squared-off composition. His inspiration still comes from the landscape, but now it is specifically the light-filled southern California landscape. Like the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism#!#resultType:masonry]Impressionist[/url] painters who also worked in series, Diebenkorn based his 140 Ocean Park paintings on the changing atmospheric effects and conditions that he perceived. There is elegance in the design and palette of this painting that only comes of being a mature painter. Although composed of flat, neat, and rectilinear planes that evoke a sense of space, the emphasis is still on the process of painting itself, with evidence of the artist's thoughts, as he scored and reworked the surface many times.

In 1813 he produced several oil studies and finished paintings, possibly including this one, of horses at the Imperial stables at Versailles. These paintings demonstrate close observation and detailed naturalism.

In this picture, we see a fine thoroughbred. Géricault has shown the moment it reacts to a bolt of lightning (in the upper right corner), and presumably, the accompanying clap of thunder. He avoided the more dramatic, and perhaps rather clichéd, image of a horse rearing, instead of showing the animal in profile as it freezes in fear.

Géricault brilliantly captured the sheen of the dappled coat as it is momentarily lit up against the near blackness of the night sky. Using short, staccato strokes of liquid paint, which precisely follow the contours of the horse's body, he created an effect of nervous energy that ripples across its silky surface.",1524,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/theodore-gericault/horse-in-the-storm-1821.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

They were inspired by the commercial color charts found in hardware stores. Here, the different colors have no particular meaning or significance. He used color functions as a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintingadvancedsearch#!#filter:advanced,minYear:-50000,maxYear:2020,dictionaries:57726bcdedc2cb3880ae735e]readymade[/url], as an object found in the hardware store and another part of consumer culture. Even though the painting mimics a commercial color chart, the colors are not grouped in the same order. Instead, the painting was created through a predetermined mathematical system, and the colors were distributed at random across the grid. The white lines that form the grid are equally spaced, and each color occupies equal space within the painting. This kind of distribution points to indifference and meaninglessness: it is part of the artist’s premise that it is impossible to combine colors in a meaningful way.

Although Richter, at the time, was unfamiliar with the works of American artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ellsworth-kelly]Ellsworth Kelly[/url], there are stylistic similarities between his color chart paintings and Kelly’s work. Kelly’s collages, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ellsworth-kelly/spectrum-colors-arranged-by-chance-vi-1951][i]Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance VI[/i][/url] (1951) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ellsworth-kelly/spectrum-colors-arranged-by-chance-ii-1951][i]Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance II[/i][/url] (1951), were similar in both style and method. Like Richter, who used a mathematical system to arrange his colors, Kelly cut up his small squares and arranged them quickly and intuitively. Both artists worked within a system but found random methods that determined their creations. The earliest versions of Richter's color chart paintings were relatively simple, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/ten-colours-1966][i]Ten Colors[/i][/url] (1966) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/color-chart-no-139-1-1966][i]Color Chart[/i][/url] (1966). By the 1970s, Richter developed the concept and created more massive and more complex color chart paintings and prints, among them [i]1024 colors[/i].

Richter’s color chart paintings were born out of a creative standstill the artist experienced during the late 1960s. Richter felt he could no longer paint figurative paintings based on photographic images, which dominated his bodywork from 1961 to 1966. Because the artist found that he was drained of ideas for his figurative paintings, he began creating imageless paintings. In this way, Richter rejected his prior work while continuing to create new artworks - his color chart paintings, reflecting his feelings of emptiness and his disenchantment with his earlier works. At the same time, it opened Richter to the exploration of pure color and form. Richter introduced abstraction to his paintings, while still following his primary method and artistic principal. He believed that the plight of the modern artist was his inability to create new paintings without relying on other pre-arranged structures.

For this reason, Richter used photographs as sources for his 1960s figurative paintings. Similarly, when he moved to color chart painting, he created another system with an infinite pool of available combinations for his paintings. Richter’s color chart paintings proved essential and consequential for his later works.  The artist used the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/4096-colours-1974][i]4096 colors[/i][/url] (1974) as a base for one of his most substantial commissions, the stained glass [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/cologne-cathedral-window-2007][i]Cologne Cathedral Window[/i][/url] (2007), which replaced the window destroyed during World War II.",505,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/gerhard-richter/1024-colours-1973.jpg,500

In this instance, even the title bears an ambiguous relation to the entire composition. In the lower region of the canvas, for instance, Richter suggests that the viewer is having a perceptual experience of looking through a window; nevertheless, the bold tracks, scrapes, smudges, and layerings of paint above playfully cancel that optical illusion. Thus Richter is frequently fascinated by how a viewer's desire to extract ""meaning"" from a given work of art often proves utterly futile. He suggests that we might instead relish a simple experience of visual pleasure, or the discovery of ""beauty"" by way of studying abstract forms for their own sake.

The central figure is being dressed as Harlequin, the clown and social outcast of European comic theater. The strips of cloth being sewn to his costume, however, derive from African ceremonial dress and from the festival of Jonkonnu, when slaves left their quarters to dance at their master's house. In the years following the Civil War, aspects of Jonkonnu became part of the celebration of the Fourth of July and Emancipation. Here, the pageantry of multihued costumes suggests a festive celebration, but it also reflects the dislocation of traditional African culture and the beginnings of its transformation into a new tradition.",1103,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/winslow-homer/the-carnival.jpg,721

The painting embodies the ancient Chinese symbolism of complementary and seemingly contrary forces. However, the work also conveys a sense of antagonism that reflects the struggle inherent in union, particularly between humans. Af Klint's signature colors, blue and yellow, appear on the birds' beaks and flippers, highlighting the quest for balance between the sexes. In The Swan No. 2, the subsequent painting in the series, the swans are thrust together, and the color created between them is now red instead of green. The redness encircles the birds, and it drips like blood from the black, ""female"" bird's wing, suggesting that the experience of passion and reproductive force can negatively obliterate female energy.

The Swan series, which takes place in the context of Paintings for The Temple, portrays a struggle between the swans that reflects the conflict between the heavenly and the underworld, good and bad, and peace and war. Many other paintings in the series depict targets for combat practice, adding to the theme of struggle. Swans, with their renowned strength and protective tendencies, are universal symbols of transcendence and completion in the alchemical tradition.

When Klint created these works, she had moved away from the more automatic painting techniques she had used in the past, towards a more researched, thoughtful, and constructed approach. Despite this shift, her connection to the spiritual world remained present, particularly through Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophical spiritual theories that had deeply interested Af Klint at the time. According to critic Mark Hudson, the works display a sophisticated visual intelligence and a timelessly enigmatic quality, making it hard to believe that they were created as long ago as 1915.",462,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/hilma-af-klint/the-swan-no-17-1915(1).jpg,476

At the time he painted Gladiators, Guston was painting murals in New York as part of a Works Progress Administration (WPA) program. Hooded Klansmen first appeared in his work of the 1930s, in response to a Ku Klux Klan attack on one of his Los Angeles murals. Of these figures, Guston said, “They are self-portraits. I perceive myself as being behind the hood. … I almost tried to imagine that I was living with the Klan.

Behind them, a female nurse stands at attention, presumably waiting to assist in the operation. Rows of seated male medical students watch the surgery. The white clothes of the doctors, the sheets covering a part of the patient's body, as well as her pale skin stand in sharp contrast to the dark tones in which the students are painted.

This painting marks the second time Eakins took as his subject a doctor teaching and performing surgery in a medical school setting. Once again, the stark and often gritty Realism for which he is best known is present in this work, but when compared with his earlier painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/the-gross-clinic-1875][i]The Gross Clinic[/i][/url] (1875), we can see a different, perhaps even more mature, approach to the subject matter. The work is notably awash in light that helps to draw the viewer to the action of the surgery. A heightened element of drama is created by choice of surgery depicted. While Dr. Agnew was a specialist in this type of operation, a mastectomy was, to the general public, a shocking and scary surgery of which little was still known. The fact that it had a high fatality rate imbues the scene with a more serious tone. Eakins placed himself in the crowd of students (on the far right of the canvas), but the inclusion of a female nurse, modeled on the first nurse graduate from the university's program, is unique to this work. Dr. Agnew, familiar with the earlier painting of Dr. Gross, insisted on not being painted with blood on his hands, as surgeons were too often associated with butchers.

The University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine students commissioned the portrait as a gift for Dr. D. Hayes Agnew, who was retiring at the end of the term. They had wanted a simple portrait of the doctor, but Eakins created a more elaborate scene at no extra fee. The successful reception of the work when it was unveiled at the school's graduation, which included a standing ovation, buoyed the artist's spirits, and set the stage for a successful, albeit not scandal-free, later career. Despite the rejection of the work from a Society of American Artists show, a slight which led to Eakins severing all ties with the organization, it was well-received when first shown to a large public at the Chicago World's Columbian Exhibition in 1893.",1779,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00142/images/57726d9aedc2cb3880b4b6e8/the-agnew-clinic-thomas-eakins.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

A melancholy and lonely mood permeates the interior scene. Guston's wife Musa McKim was said to have had a quality of ""dreamy inwardness,"" which is suggested in the portrait. The assortment of earth and mineral-derived pigments—siennas, ochres, umbers, and blues—that Guston used, and the dry quality of the pigment, were also influenced by the materials and techniques of fresco mural and early Renaissance painting.

Guston said that what ultimately caused him to leave his figurative narratives of the 1940s was seeing early pictures of Nazi-death camps. It is easy to imagine how those shocking images of stacked bodies could override any potential idea for figuratively realistic composition.",500,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/philip-guston/the-young-mother-1944.jpg,668

The inspiration for the unique lighting effect came during an 1885 boating trip Sargent took with fellow painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edwin-austin-abbey]Edwin Austin Abbey[/url]. On one evening, near the Thames at Pangbourne, he saw Chinese lanterns hanging from trees spreading light over beds of flowers. After Pangbourne, Sargent stayed with artist Francis David Millet at Farm House in Broadway, Worcestershire; and there he began working on the painting. Sargent’s progress was slow; he worked on the painting from September 1885 and completed it sometime in October 1886. It was because Sargent was determined to recreate the light effect from Pangbourne, and painted only a few minutes every evening to capture the same level of light at dusk. 

The painting depicts two children lighting Chinese lanterns in a garden. The painting is set in the garden of the Cotswolds village of Broadway, and the models were Dolly and Polly Barnard, the daughters of Sargent’s friend, illustrator Frederick Bernard. He chose Dolly and Polly, who were 11 and 7 years old, because their light blonde hair complemented the color scheme. Sargent produced sketches and studies like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/dorothy-barnard-1885][i]Dorothy Barnard[/i][/url] (1885-1886) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/study-of-polly-barnard-for-carnation-lily-lily-rose][i]Polly Barnard[/i][/url] (1885-1886) to capture them in their natural poses when painting. Each evening Sargent would prepare his easel and paints, and pose the girls ahead of time to catch the perfect light before it quickly disappeared. As autumn came, the flowers died, and Sargent had to replace them with artificial flowers. One of Sargent’s main preoccupations with the painting was the composition, and he gradually cut two feet off from the left side of the canvas. By doing this, Sargent created an almost square format that resulted in a more concentrated composition. 

The title of the painting came from “[i]The Wreath[/i],” an 18th-century song by opera composer Joseph Mazzinghi. The chorus of the songs has the lines: “[i]Tell me have you seen my Flora pass this way? A wreath around her head, around her head she wore, Carnation, lily, lily, rose[/i]”. The song possibly relates to the ambiance at Broadway, where Sargent and his friends would spend their evenings singing around the piano. 

The painting was first exhibited in 1887 at the Royal Academy exhibition, where it received praise from audiences and critics. In 1887, [i]Tate Gallery[/i] purchased the painting, an acquisition that was supported by influential figures such as the Royal Academy President [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederic-leighton]Sir Frederic Leighton[/url]. The painting is part of the Tate collection and is displayed at [i]Tate Britain[/i] in London.",1062,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/00142/images/john-singer-sargent/carnation-lily-lily-rose-from-the-world-s-greatest-paintings-published-by-oldham-s-press-in-1920.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

A mother and a naked child gather dandelions on the sparse shore behind him. It is unclear whether the child will be fed or has already starved. This canvas is one of Puvis's most well-known works and offers a glimpse into his personal psychology, displaying a private mood that is rarely shown in his large-scale paintings. The painting was developed over several years through sketches and painted studies and executed during a personally challenging time for the artist.

After the success of his first murals in Paris in 1878, Puvis was anxious about his future prospects and the amount of artistic freedom he would have. When he showed this work at the Salon of 1881, Puvis indicated that he wanted it to be regarded in ""human, natural terms,"" with no religious, mystical, or philosophical symbolism. In European art, paintings of fishing often had Christian overtones, and Puvis had created such pictures before (such as Miraculous Draught of Fishes and The Fisherman). By insisting that there was no such symbolism in this work, Puvis introduced an element of realism without losing the attention of an audience accustomed to viewing religious subjects.

Puvis had reservations about showing this work at the Salon of 1881, as it departed considerably in both subject matter and style from his earlier triumphs. Conservative critics criticized it, taking issue with the lack of traditional proportion and shading. However, it won him the respect of a new group of admirers, including Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, who championed the work and referenced it in later writing. Maurice Denis specifically admired the work and called for a new type of painting in his publication ""Definition of Neo-Traditionalism."" Interestingly, Aristide Maillol executed a direct copy of this work, despite being a sculptor, printmaker, and sculptor-painter.",1464,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/pierre-puvis-de-chavannes/the-poor-fisherman.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

[i]The Champion Single Sculls[/i] is the first significant work in that series of paintings and watercolors. It is believed to commemorate the victory of Max Schmitt, a friend of the artist and skilled amateur rower, in an important race on the Schuylkill River in October 1870. Also an avid rower, Eakins depicted himself pulling the oars of a scull in the middle distance.

The theme of rowing plays into Eakins’ own love of sports and his tendency toward masculine themes, as well as the contemporary interest in the moral virtues and health benefits of outdoor recreational activities. In an era in which American printmakers were just beginning to take up the rowing craze and memorialize victorious single scullers as gentlemen and regional heroes, Eakins produced nineteen such rowing images.
[i]The Champion Single Sculls[/i] debuted to mixed reviews, with one critic noting the “scattered effect” of “dealing so boldly and broadly with the commonplace in nature.” Nevertheless, it marked Eakins’ first major success by demonstrating his remarkable technical skill. It also exhibits the artist’s quirky sense of humor: instead of inscribing his signature in the painting’s corner, Eakins subtly included his name and the date on the boat he is shown rowing in the distance. 

[i]The Champion Single Sculls[/i] is ultimately a snapshot of Eakins, his environment, and his times. Utilizing the Philadelphia-area Schuylkill River as his backdrop (a landmark he would indirectly visit again in his 1877 [url href=William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuykill River]portrait of William Rush[/url]), Eakins is domesticating an exotic genre, that of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/orientalism]Orientalist[/url] river scenes by artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-leon-gerome]Jean-Léon Gérôme[/url] and Frederick Arthur Bridgman.",1732,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/00129/images/thomas-eakins/max-schmitt-in-a-single-scull.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The two men contemplating the sinking moon have been identified as Friedrich himself, on the right, and his talented young colleague August Heinrich (1794–1822). The mood of pious contemplation relates to fascination with the moon as expressed in contemporary poetry, literature, philosophy, and music. Both figures are seen from the back so that the viewer can participate in their communion with nature, which the Romantics saw as a manifestation of the Sublime.
Although the landscape is imaginary, it is based on studies after nature that Friedrich had made in various regions at different times. Both men wear Old German dress, which had been adopted in 1815 by radical students as an expression of opposition to the ultraconservative policies then being enforced in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. The staunchly patriotic Friedrich deliberately ignored the 1819 royal decree forbidding this practice and depicted figures in traditional costume until his death.",650,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/caspar-david-friedrich/not-detected-1(1).jpg,518

Even though the painting was named Madame *** (later changed to Madame X), the subject was easily recognizable as the young socialite Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau. Unlike most of Sargent's portraits, [i]Madame X[/i] was not a commission: the artist sought out Gautreau and asked to paint her. 

Gautreau was an unconventional beauty known for lavender powdered skin and a highly stylized appearance. Sargent believed she was a great charmer and a subject worthy of grand portrait that would excite Parisian art circles. Both American expatriates, the two had overlapping ambitions as they were establishing themselves in Parisian high society. Gautreau was encouraged by her mother to accept Sargent’s offer. In June 1883 the artist traveled to Gautreau’s estate in Brittany to execute [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/madame-gautreau-1883]preliminary studies and sketches[/url] for the portrait. Depicting Gautreau’s painted skin was a challenge for Sargent; he struggled at times to capture the artificial blue and lavender tones of her complexion. At one point, Sargent became so frustrated with his unsuccessful attempts that he decided to start a new portrait, leaving the unfinished version [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/study-of-mme-gautreau-1884][i]Study of Madame Gautreau[/i][/url] (Madame X) (ca. 1884). 

All parties were anticipating success and were unprepared for the devastating outcome: the painting received more ridicule than praise, and it was panned for being a distasteful display of vanity. For the salon audience, the artwork was too brazen: Gautreau's pose is sensual and suggestive, and her presentation is lavish and extravagant. She wears a sumptuous satin gown, a black dress that stands in contrast to her artificially pale skin. Gautreau was known for her bold use of makeup, which was still uncommon among French upper classes. Women were encouraged to use cosmetics moderately to achieve a ‘natural look’ with slightly colored cheeks and lips or thickened eyebrows and eyelashes. 

Sargent defended his work vigorously saying his depiction was accurate to reality and his sitter’s appearance. He resisted the negative criticism, which prompted Gautreau’s mother to beg him to take the painting down. Even though [i]Madame X[/i] remained at the Salon, Sargent did make one amendment. When the portrait was first presented the right shoulder strap on Madame X’s dress falls off the side, an element that contributed to the suggestive and sexual nature of the painting. Sargent repainted the shoulder strap but resisted pressures to make any further changes. 

Gautreau was publically humiliated and mocked for her American crudeness. Later, her beauty was captured by other artists in portraits like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/antonio-de-la-gandara/portrait-of-mme-pierre-gaudreau-1898][i]Madame Pierre Gautreau[/i][/url] (1898) by Antonio de La Gándara and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-claude-etienne-courtois/madame-gautreau-1891][i]Madame Gautreau[/i][/url] (1891) by Gustave Courtois. Sargent was also humiliated: critics compared [i]Madame X[/i] to a plastic idol or ghost. After the Salon Sargent left Paris and moved to London, where he continued to build his career. [i]Madame X[/i] remained in Sargent’s possession until 1916, when the artist finally sold the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sargent remarked that the portrait was probably the best work he ever produced.

We see before us, spread laterally across the picture surface, an uninhabited cityscape. The background consists of the sky, punctuated by the hotel sign, telephone poles, and vents - all indicators of contact with people and the outside world. In the middle ground sits the hotel itself, with shops below at street level, in front of which is a fence separating it from - at the same time, it unites with - the foreground chain link fence and railroad tracks. These railroad tracks also connect to the outside world, leading, as they do, out of town. They contrast with the homey, but stately and enduring, presence of the warmly lit hotel. The streetlamp at the far right balances all the horizontals in the painting while helping to fill in the negative space of the sky. Significantly, it is not lit - it is the warm light of day on the rich stucco surface that has captured the artist's attention. The artist's treatment of the formal elements of this work points to his innate sense of the abstract surface, which would become characteristic of his work.

His later mentor was Giuseppe Maria Crespi, who painted studies of contemporary life, and was thus one of the reasons why Longhi was able to succeed as a popular artist.

Sargent's friendship with Monet developed during his student days at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and he visited Monet's home in Giverny multiple times during the 1880s. In this painting, Sargent employs Monet's en plein air technique to depict his friend painting nature directly outdoors, with Monet's wife Alice sitting patiently in the background.

While the image on Monet's easel shows a sky scene, Sargent focuses more on the two figures and the interplay of light on the grass and trees. This impressionistic style is quite different from Sargent's more realistic approach to portraiture. Nevertheless, the painting's exploration of the relationship between Monet and Alice exemplifies Sargent's strength as an artist, that of capturing the dynamics of human relationships in his works.",1140,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/john-singer-sargent/claude-monet-painting-by-the-edge-of-a-wood-1885.jpg,956

This is a unique painting in Sargent’s body of work, who is best known for fashionable portraits, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/lady-agnew-of-lochnaw][i]Lady Agnew of Lochnaw[/i][/url] (1892) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/the-wyndham-sisters-1899][i]The Wyndham Sisters: Lady Elcho, Mrs. Adeane, and Mrs. Tennant[/i][/url] (1899). In May 1918, Sargent was commissioned by the British government to create a large painting for the Hall of Remembrance for World War I. As an American painter, Sargent was asked to create a painting that represented the idea of Anglo-American cooperation. In 1918, Sargent traveled to France with fellow artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henry-tonks]Henry Tonks[/url] to observe the troops on the Western Front, visiting the Guards Division at Bavincourt and the American Division at Ypres. Sargent struggled to find a suitable subject for the painting, he wanted to paint an epic showing masses of men, but could not find a scene that featured many British and American soldiers. Sargent considered several ideas before deciding to paint the aftermath of the mustard gas attack he witnessed while in France. He described the incident in a letter to biographer Evan Charteris as  [i]‘one harrowing sight, a field full of gassed and blindfolded men’[/i]. 

[i]Gassed[/i], a painting of a heroic scale (231x611 cm) shows several lines of wounded soldiers moving toward the dressing station. The scene is dark and tragic: the soldiers blinded by the gas have their eyes bandaged, they hold onto each other as medical orderlies assist them. All around them are bodies of wounded and dead piled on top of one another. 

Sargent exposes the reality of war and the horrific impact of chemical weapons, his heroes are helpless and broken men, whose fates are a mystery - will they recover or see again, will they even survive? There is also activity in the background, biplanes flying through the sky and a group of soldiers playing football. Sargent’s painting examines the harsh realities of war: the poor conditions and equipment of the troops and the human suffering caused by the gas attack. The ongoing football match indicates how these horrors have become a constant presence that no longer interrupts the daily routine.

Sargent painting draws on the tradition of heroic paintings: the composition was inspired by the triptych [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-uccello/the-battle-of-san-romano-1440][i]The Battle of San Romano[/i][/url] (ca.1435-1460) by Florentine painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-uccello]Paolo Uccello[/url]. Some have also suggested that the central group of figures was inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder]Pieter Bruegel[/url]’s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/parable-of-the-blind-1568][i]The Parable of the Blind[/i][/url] (1568) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/auguste-rodin]Auguste Rodin[/url]’s sculpture [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/auguste-rodin/burghers-of-calais][i]The Burghers of Calais[/i][/url] (1884-1889). [i]Gassed[/i] was first exhibited in 1919 at the Royal Academy in London, and it was voted picture of the year by the Royal Academy of Arts. Although the painting received high praise from Winston Churchill, it also had some notable critics. The novelists E.M. Forster and Virginia Woolf both criticized [i]Gassed[/i] for being naively patriotic. Today the painting belongs to the collection of the Imperial War Museum in London.",1920,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/john-singer-sargent/gassed-1918(1).jpg!HD.jpg,717

Boccioni took a year to complete it and it was exhibited throughout Europe shortly after it was finished. It testifies to the hold that Neo-Impressionism and Symbolism maintained on the movement's artists even after Futurism was inaugurated in 1909. It was not until around 1911 that Boccioni adapted elements of Cubism to create a distinct Futurist style. Nevertheless, The City Rises does capture the group's love of dynamism and their fondness for the modern city. A large horse races into the foreground while several workers struggle to gain control of it, suggesting a primeval conflict between humanity and beasts. The horse and figures are blurred, communicating rapid movement while other elements, such as the buildings in the background, are rendered more realistically. At the same time, the perspective teeters dramatically in different sections of the painting.",1024,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/umberto-boccioni/the-city-rises-1910(2).jpg,680

Following an apprenticeship in a Boston lithography shop, he supported himself as a freelance illustrator, creating a wide variety of popular images that subsequently were published as wood engravings in national periodicals like [i]Harper's Weekly[/i]. During the early 1860s, his themes ranged from the stylish seaside-resort life to the horrors of the battlefield. Following an extended trip to Europe in 1866–1867, Homer adopted a warmer palette, a looser brush technique, and an interest in painting outdoor scenes that owed much to the influence of contemporary French artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Courbet[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Manet[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Monet[/url].

Upon his return to the United States, Homer turned his attention to lively scenes of sports and recreation, painting warm and appealing images that perfectly suited the prevalent postwar nostalgia for a simpler, more innocent America. [i]Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)[/i], painted during the country's centennial year, has become one of the best–known and most beloved artistic images of life in 19th–century America. 

Exhibited to critical praise, [i]Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)[/i] shows a working father and his three sons on a catboat in the afternoon. Similar to a modern-day snapshot, the fishing boat seems about to speed out of view, the top of its mast already cropped out of the painting. Contrasting the sense of determined movement of the small craft in the foreground, a large sailboat leisurely crosses in the far background. Like his earlier works, Homer realistically depicted the scene, without a touch of sentiment. The stern look on the father's face as he steers the small boat is contrasted by the youthful postures of his sons, lost in their own thoughts, not quite attuned to the pressures of the adult's world. Perhaps this subtle contrast helped make the work one of Homer's most-loved depictions.

This simple painting, which appears so quintessentially American in tone demonstrates the influence of his brief stay in France in the previous decade. The subject reflects concerns he shared with the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/realism]Realist[/url] painters of France who similarly put the working figures in the immediate foreground of the composition. There is also a shift in Homer's gestural brushstrokes, which became increasingly confident after his trip to Paris, most notably in the sky and the sea. Finally, the compositional structure reveals a debt to the lessons of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/japonism]Japonism[/url] - the juxtaposition of extremely close-up objects against those in the deep background are seen from a slightly elevated position. In both style and subject, [i]Breezing Up[/i] anticipates themes that will resurface and dominate his oeuvre after his second trip to Europe in 1881.",1300,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/winslow-homer/breezing-up-a-fair-wind-1876.jpg,809

The magazine sent him to sketch scenes from the local circus for two weeks, and so began a lifelong interest. In 1926 he moved to Paris and created his Cirque Calder, a sort of travelling circus set made from cloth, leather, wire and found materials. The pieces represented circus performers which were designed to be manipulated manually by Calder. Soon he was presenting his Cirque Calder in both Paris and New York to much acclaim. The performance lasted two hours and in many ways predated performance art by 40 years. Cirque Calder is now part of the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum in New York, but a live performance carried out by the artist in later years can be seen on youtube.com.",1438,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/alexander-calder/calder-s-circus-1931.jpg,1193

Filonov completed dozens of works during this period, including The Narva Gates, hopeful of their critical reception. Unfortunately, the new Soviet regime, which controlled almost all aspects of social life, was disapproving of Filonov’s analytical style, and forbade the exhibition of his works.

As the still-handsome Gray leads an increasingly dissolute and evil life, his painted representation rots and decays, revealing the extent of his moral corruption. Albright's renown as a painter of the macabre made him the ideal choice of Albert Lewin, the director of the movie, to paint the horrific image of Gray.

Painted for Marquis Filippo Ala Ponzoni, a patron of the arts, patriot and follower of Giuseppe Mazzini, this picture owed its popularity both to its outstanding quality and to its emblematic value, making it a symbol of the restlessness of Romanticism. The subject belongs to the half-figure category inspired by the 17th century Emilian school’s Sibyllas and Cleopatras which Hayez revisited with a greater focus on the figures’ moods. The wilting flowers also remind us of the transcience of human affairs.

Critics have interpreted these works as potent expressions of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, an idea of great currency in the late 19th century. [i]Fox Hunt[/i] was Homer's largest canvas. He dramatized the brutal realities of winter on the Maine coast by showing a fox desperately bounding through deep snow in an attempt to flee a flock of half-starved crows. The birds descend ominously with outstretched wings, forming a dark hovering mass above the struggling fox. However, the sharp diagonal created by the fox, matched by the artist's signature in the lower-left corner, suggests a sense of motion for the animal and allows the viewer to determine the conclusion to this dramatic scene.

That viewers witness the scene from the fox's vantage point heighten's sense of tension and empathy. Homer's carefully designed composition, indebted to his study of Japanese woodblock prints ( seen on his Paris trip in 1876), supports the unfolding drama. The fox's red silhouette is splashed across a field of oppressive snow; we sense that he is cornered, trapped within the flattened white plane while the aggressive birds break its edges on the descent. This striking reversal of the natural order, in which the bird becomes predator and the fox prey, has become one of the artist's most haunting and successful images. The Pennsylvania Academy purchased [i]Fox Hunt[/i] in 1893, the first of Homer's works to enter a public collection.",1107,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/winslow-homer/fox-hunt.jpg,613

She holds a bundle of a rose and some leaves, which she ties together with a ribbon, as if she just picked them from the beautiful gardens of Versailles, as suggested by the rosebush, small patch of sky, and large tree in the background. Although this portrait meets the requirements of a royal painting, the queen's knowing smile implies that there is something more to the story.

The painting of Marie-Antoinette that we see today is actually a replacement for a scandalous work that was originally displayed at the artist's first Salon entry in 1783. The original painting depicted the queen in a simple chemise dress, without the restrictive corset, and her natural hair, slightly tousled, pulled back under a straw hat, instead of the refined blue silk and lace gown and required royal accoutrements. Additionally, she held a pink rose, which was interpreted as a symbol of her Habsburg identity, rather than symbolizing the wealth and grandeur of the luxurious royal gardens. After facing public outcry, it was promptly removed and replaced with the portrait we see here.

The intricate and luxurious textures of the queen's attire, from the crisp satin and delicate lace of her dress to the feathery puffs of her wig, signify her wealth, elegance, and royal status. The features of the Habsburg family are softened, as in all of Vigée Le Brun's portraits of the queen, producing an exceptionally flattering image. Her elongated neck, erect posture, and composed gaze all convey a sense of power.

One of the most famous of such ambushes was the destruction of the 'Mansourija'.

Guggenheim Museum, New York City, NY, US']",['female-portraits'],"The style of this portrait, with its simplified forms and flat color, blends aspects of Symbolism and Fauvism and is typical of Picabia's maturing style as he began to try his hand at different approaches. Painted at a time when he was slowly building a conventional, successful career as an Impressionist, it might be taken as a sign of Picabia's frequent later habit of striking out in new and surprising directions. The model for the picture, Mistinguett, was a successful actress and singer, and was one of Picabia's first famous friends from the entertainment industry (she was at one time the lover of Maurice Chevalier). Independently wealthy, Picabia enjoyed the life of the bon viveur and was often drawn to music halls, nightclubs, circuses, and the cinema. He met Mistinguett during one of his visits to the Parisian revues. Instead of painting a realistic portrayal of her, he was much more interested in revealing the mood of the time by using dramatic color and composition. - See more at: http://www.theartstory.org/artist-picabia-francis.htm#sthash.xchIYynP.dpuf",942,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/francis-picabia/portrait-of-jeanne-marie-bourgeois-1917.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Therefore, the entire work is the full recording of the mind of the person who completed the painting. As such, this painting is more than a representation of a family, it expresses Filonov’s intellectual understanding and emotional awareness of the subject.

The three viewpoints were chosen to enable the sculptor to create a truly three-dimensional likeness.
The sculpture was intended as a papal present to Queen Henrietta Maria. After the bust was finished, the painting remained in the possession of Bernini and passed to his descendants. It was brought back to England in 1802 and entered the Royal Collection in 1822. The bust itself was a great success with the King and Queen.

The intent of the work is clearly given by the subtitle: ""Whoever makes a DESIGN without the Knowledge of PERSPECTIVE will be liable to such Absurdities as are shewn in this Frontiſpiece"".
The work shows a scene that provides many deliberate examples of confused and misplaced perspective effects. Although the individual components of the scene seem self-consistent, the scene itself can be classed as an example of an impossible object.

Partial list of ""Errors"":
The most immediately prominent errors are the first three or four:
The man in the foreground's fishing rod's line passes behind that of the man behind him.
The sign is moored to two buildings, one in front of the other, with beams that show no difference in depth
The sign is overlapped by two distant trees.
The man climbing the hill is lighting his pipe with the candle of the woman leaning out of the upper story window.
The crow perched on the tree is massive in comparison to it.
The church appears to front onto the river. Both ends of the church are viewable at the same time.
The left horizon on the water declines precipitously.
The man in the boat under the bridge fires at the swan on the other side, which is impossible as he's aiming straight at the bridge abutments.
The right-hand end of the arch above the boat meets the water further from the viewer than does the left-hand end.
The two story building, though viewed from below shows the top of the roof. As does the church tower in the distance.
The barrel closest to the foreground fisherman reveals both its top and bottom simultaneously.
The tiles the foreground fisherman stands on have a vanishing point that converge towards the viewer.
A tree is growing out of the top of the bridge.
The vanishing point for the near side of the first building transforms midway down the wall.
The line of trees obscuring the sign are likely representative of how objects should decrease in scale as they move further away, but in this case reversed.
The sheep on the left-hand side increase in scale as they get further away.
The swan behind the boat is larger than the men manning the boat.
The base of the tree on the far left is behind the tree to the right it, but the canopy is in front of the tree to the right of it.
The left-most barrel appears to be on lower ground than the other two when they should be on level ground.
The bottom swan is slightly smaller than the cow.
The man with the pipe is taller than the trees.
You can see the tops and bottoms of the right and center barrels.
The tops and bottoms of the windows on the second building have different vanishing points.
Aside from the impossibilities of scale there are in fact approximately 10 different horizons based on the various vanishing points.",762,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/william-hogarth/the-importance-of-knowing-perspective-absurd-perspectives.jpg,959

Richter suggests only a shallow space akin to that of a mirror. The viewer is finally coaxed to set aside all searches for ""content"" that might originate from outside these narrow parameters and find satisfaction in the object's beauty in and of itself, as though one were relishing a fine textile. One thus appreciates the numerous colors and transitions that occur in this painting, many having been created outside the complete control of the artist much as nature often creates wondrous optical pleasures partly by design, and partly by accident.

The book features a poem by Cendrars about the poet's journey through Russia on the Trans-Siberian Express in 1905, during the first Russian Revolution, together with Jeanne, a French prostituted girl. The text interlaced with an almost-abstract pochoir print by Delaunay. The work, published in 1913, is considered a milestone in the evolution of artist's books as well as modernist poetry and abstract art.

This long-format illustration can be considered a ""simultaneous book."" It is a two-meter long book, pleated in the manner of an accordion, exhibiting the artist's technique of manipulating color for maximum expression. Patches of non-uniformly shaped color and text printed in different colors (not the expected black) and typefaces, guide the reader around the text and reflect the mood and content of Cendrars' poem. The planned print run of 150 copies was purposefully meant to reach 300 feet high (if all copies are connected end-to-end) - the height of the Eiffel Tower.

The publisher of a 2008 reprint of the book has called it ""one of the most beautiful books ever created"". Cendrars himself referred to the work as ‘[i]a sad poem printed on sunlight[/i]’.",680,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/00288/images/sonia-delaunay/sonia-delaunay-la-prose-du-transsiberien-et-de-la-petite-jehanne-de-france-1.jpg,300

But he transforms the theme profoundly, stripping the muses of the traditional attributes which allow them to be identified.

In the group of three women sitting in the foreground we can see the figure of Marthe, whom the painter married in June 1893 and who inspired his art until her death. In a device common in Denis' work, she is shown twice: in profile in red and from the back, sitting on the chair. Maurice Denis has set the scene on the terrace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the town where he lived all his life. The century-old chestnut trees give the composition rhythm and decorative power. The regular strokes of the tree trunks are a pretext for a play of vertical lines which contrast with the curves and ornamental arabesques of the branches, the leaves strewn on the ground, and the patterns and folds of the dresses. The graphic play of lines and interlacing is intensified by the unreal, autumnal colours, painted in areas of flat colour and neatly outlined. The flattened space is that of a ""sacred wood"", the setting for a revelation and the figures' mysterious communication with nature and supernatural powers. An enigmatic tenth muse in the background (while traditionally there are only nine), with one arm raised to the light of the sky, convinces us of that.",632,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/maurice-denis/the-muses-1893.jpg,800

By 1900, however, the painting was well on its way to becoming a national icon. That year, inspired by Gyzis's painting, the poet Ioannis Polemis (1862–1924) wrote ""The Secret School,""33 which, through its inclusion in school textbooks, served to further perpetuate the myth.",1024,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/nikolaos-gyzis/the-underground-school-1885.jpg,768

Originally titled [i]Far Away from Billingsgate[/i], this watercolor was later renamed [i]Mending the Nets[/i] after Homer scratched away the scenery behind the two engaged in the title activity. The simplicity of the local lifestyle appealed to his interest and gave him a new selection of genre subjects loosely related to his increasing interest in marine scenes. The high level of detail in the work, especially in the figures' hair and the fishing net, evidences Homer's great skill with the difficult medium. The women wear tattered clothes and are focused on their work, a sharp contrast to Homer's earlier compositions of genteel women often engaged in recreational activities.

It was the style, more than the subject, of Homer's English period that seems to have caught his critics off guard, with one noting in the [i]New York Times[/i], ""They are English in method and style. One needs to read the signed named before believing that the maker of those British watercolors is the same who used to rouse the wrath or admiration of the critics by his quaint conceits, his bald oddities, his lovely transcripts of scenes that only he knew how to depict."" The historian Nicolas Cikovsky credits the sparsity of style ""in order to achieve the effect of figures against a plain, unlocalized background"" to the influence of Ancient Greek relief sculpture, crediting this newfound sense of compositional space to the metopes of friezes of the fragments of the Parthenon (also known as the ""Elgin Marbles"") Homer would have seen at British Museum in London.",857,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/winslow-homer/mending-the-nets.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Until this point, however, Europeans had minimal contact with the East, usually through trade and intermittent military campaigns. In 1798, a French army led by General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt and occupied the country until 1801. The European presence in Egypt attracted Western travelers to the Near and Middle East and enhanced connection between two worlds.

Throughout his career, Géricault created many fine portraits. The subject of [i]Head of an Oriental man[/i] was a real man, a domestic servant of Géricault, a Tunisian Arab named Mustafa Sussen. Apparently, he was a survivor of a shipwreck. Géricault had found him in a Paris street and brought home as a model and companion. It is probably his features, dark eyes sad beneath his turban, that are depicted in several late studies of a Turk that strike the viewer as warmly individualized portraits. Mustafa posed as a model for other painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet]Anne-Louis Girodet[/url] ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet/mustapha-1819][i]Mustapha[/i][/url], 1819) or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/horace-vernet]Horace Vernet[/url] ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/horace-vernet/a-man-in-oriental-costume-1818][i]A Man in Oriental Costume[/i][/url], 1818). 

A vital aspect of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] movement was the full embrace of exotic ""oriental"" themes in art. Like many artists of the period, Géricault was interested in the world beyond Western Europe. The artist desired to visit the Holy Land so that he could experience the Middle East in all its sounds, sights, and interactions. However, he never managed to travel there and therefore relied on books he read, works with related subjects he collected, and most importantly, his servant Mustapha. 

Géricault led the way for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/orientalism]Orientalist[/url] artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix]Eugène Delacroix[/url], Léon Cognet, and Eugène Fromentin, whose travels in Northern Africa formed an essential part of their inspiration.",527,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/theodore-gericault/head-of-an-oriental-or-portrait-presumed-to-be-mustapha-1821.jpg,650

Like Analysis of Beauty, Characters Caricaturas and Boys Peeping at Nature it represents a statement by Hogarth upon the nature of art and aesthetic values. It also represents a scathing commentary upon the business auction houses, institutions whose ethics are as suspect today as they were in the eighteenth century. The auction house appears to the left. A crack symbolically appears on its front wall. To the side of the main door an over-framed painting rests. To the front of the auction house stand long rows of pictures. The first is original but all the others are copies or fakes.

William Hogarth's studio appears to the right. Appearing on the easel is a painting from ""Marriage a la Mode"". Other canvases from ""The Four Times of the Day"" (Morning), ""A Harlot's Progress"" and ""A Rake's Progress"" are also apparent. A grouping of old master paintings, such as representations of St. Francis and Mary Magdalene, lead an attack, some stabbing through Hogarth's outnumbered paintings.

In ""Time Smoking a Picture"" Hogarth attacked the general fashion in England for collecting 'old master' paintings in poor condition or of suspicious quality. In ""The Battle of the Pictures"" Hogarth is fighting a losing battle against bad art.

This original engraving was both designed and engraved by William Hogarth and published by William Heath in 1822.",1290,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/william-hogarth/the-battle-of-the-pictures-1745.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The panel was thus one of the works commissioned by the Medici to van der Weyden, including the Medici Madonna now at Städel of Frankfurt, which has been also assigned to the artist's trip to Italy in 1450. Another hypothesis is that the panel was part of a lost triptych painted for Lionello d'Este of Ferrara, and mentioned in 1449, or that it was the painting described by Giorgio Vasari as Hans Memling's.

The panel adopts the same scheme in Fra Angelico's Pietà for the predella of the San Marco Altarpiece (1438–1443), now at the Alte Pinakothek of Munich, confirming that the Flemish artist visited Florence during his pilgrimage in Italy of 1449-1450, as confirmed by De viribus illustribus by Bartolomeo Facio (c. 1456). The work was later part of the collections of cardinal Carlo de' Medici, being moved to the Uffizi Gallery in 1666. Filippo Baldinucci described it as a work by Albrecht Dürer. In 1989 it was still assigned to Hans Memling by some scholars, but in 1992 a 1992 a reflex photography showed the underlying drawing, which was clearly executed by van der Weyden.

The painting has a rectangular shape, and shows Christ being buried with the weeping Mary and John the Evangelist holding his hands. The corpse is supported by a richly dressed Joseph of Arimathea (identified by some as a portrait of Cosimo de' Medici) and by Nicodemus, perhaps a self-portrait of the artist. A kneeling Mary Magdalene is depicted in the low foreground.

The composition is similar to Angelico's Pietà, but the scene here is more complex and crowded, with less geometrically ordered lines and more anguished faces. The use of oil paint also allowed van der Weyden to obtain deeper colors and a more brilliant light. The attention to details is also typical of the early Netherlandish painting school.",1029,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/rogier-van-der-weyden/entombment-of-christ-1450(2).jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Antonietta’s father, Pedro (sometimes written as Pedrus) Gonzalez, was the first known person to be affected with this disorder. Given the rarity of the disease, it seems a little surprising that so many people within the Gonzalez family were affected by hypertrichosis. One writer noted that in terms of pathology, “the Gonzales sisters were one in a billion – all three of them.” 

Antonietta and her sisters were welcomed into the courts of Europe, having received considerable attention from physicians and nobles alike and also being subject to medical investigations and portrait sittings. Antonietta explains a little of her personal history in the handwritten note which she holds in the portrait: “Don Pietro, a wild man discovered in the Canary Islands, was conveyed to his most serene highness Henry the king of France, and from there came to his Excellency the Duke of Parma. From whom [came] I, Antonietta, and now I can be found nearby at the court of the Lady Isabella Pallavicina, the honorable Marchesa of Soragna.” Historian Merry Weisner-Hanks has speculated that Lavinia Fontana met Antonietta in Parma.

Perhaps hinting at this return to representational form, [i]Berkeley No. 8[/i] - as opposed to his earlier Abstract Expressionist works - exhibits a more expanded view of the landscape, with an increased number of forms and more varied detail. In the lower right quadrant, the artist introduces additional overlapping and, therefore, more of a spatial component - a suggestion of depth - as well as supplementary diagonal lines and shapes that interrupt the flatness and surface orientation of earlier examples of his work. In this painting, it has been suggested that Diebenkorn was influenced by the landscapes of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chaim-soutine]Chaim Soutine[/url], with their divided surfaces and diagonal intrusions, but more importantly - in view of the fact that the work is both drawn and painted - it relates to and ties together the two kinds of Abstract Expressionism: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/action-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]gestural abstraction[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/color-field-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Color Field Painting[/url], as exemplified in the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/willem-de-kooning]Willem de Kooning[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko]Mark Rothko[/url], respectively.

Colors for a Large Wall helped introduce his deeply held view of paintings as objects; not only was this painting an object in itself, but it was comprised of many smaller objects (panels) supposedly having come together in chance collision. In this work, Kelly covered each of the 64 square canvases in a single color and fused them together based on a collage study he had arbitrarily arranged. Much of Kelly's subsequent work stemmed from this painting, as he continued to juxtapose panels of differing sizes, shapes, colors and materials in innumerable variations.",545,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/ellsworth-kelly/colors-for-a-large-wall-1951.jpg,546

The detractors, on the other hand, headed by Ilya Repin, saw Petrov-Vodkin as a decadent artist, unable to develop his work. It was in part this heated discussion by two of Russia’s most famous painters, over one of Petrov-Vodkin’s works, that he was catapulted to fame so quickly when he debuted his Bathing of a Red Horse two years later.

At the time he was reading Sagesse, a collection of poems by Verlaine. Denis' carving illustrated the first poem. The painting is the plastic equivalent of Verlaine's poetic style which the painter appreciated for its simplicity, naivety and the ""mysterious relationships between things and people"". The composition is carried by a rising diagonal formed by the group of women and the upright of the Cross. The women have lost all individuality and melt into an extremely simplified black mass, counterbalanced by the other dark mass of Roman soldiers in the background. Even Christ, brought to his knees by the weight of the Cross and embraced by a Holy Woman, is painted as a silhouette, in flat colour with a dark outline. Denis has given the scene great decorative unity and, as in Verlaine's poem, it becomes the expression of universal grief and compassion.",496,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/maurice-denis/the-road-to-calvary.jpg,630

This work must have been painted when he was in his early twenties, and it already shows the painter's astonishing descriptive gifts fully developed.
Although the subject of the picture is traditional, Mantegna has incorporated details that give prominence to artistic achievement and also enhance the expressive treatment of the figures. He also incorporates a strategy of devotional literature of the period that urges the reader to imagine the Biblical events of the distant past in terms of contemporary, everyday life. The classically garbed figure of the sleeping Joseph thus serves as a counterpoint to the two shepherds, who are shown in tattered, contemporary dress, one with hands joined prayerfully, the other having doffed his hat; both about to kneel. The rocky foreground contrasts with the gentle green plane in the distance where, on the banks of the curving river, can be seen a shepherd greeted by an angel and a man with two barrels waiting for the arrival of a barge on the opposite bank; also shown is a seated woman spinning and chickens feeding. The Virgin is shown in rapt devotion, with her child lying on the hem of her robe in an audaciously foreshortened pose, his head surrounded by cherubim, their features highlighted with shell gold.

The enormous canvas (237x352 cm) that depicts a flamenco performance became an overnight sensation with French audiences and critics. 

The painting is an example of Hispanism, an intricate 19th-century phenomenon in Europe and the United States that refers to a widespread fascination with everything related to Spanish culture. Hispanism had a pervasive influence in different fields. Some famous examples include literary works by Theophile Gautier and Washington Irving, and George Bizet’s opera [i]Carmen[/i] that premiered in Paris in 1875. However, for Sargent, who spent the autumn of 1879 in Spain, the subject of flamenco was more than a fashion choice. The trip to Spain was a formative experience: he copied works of old Spanish masters at the Prado Museum and made live sketches of folk dancers. While traveling through Southern Spain, he observed flamenco performances and became particularly fond of Andalusian Gypsy music. Thus, the choice of subject for [i]El Jaleo[/i] was likely a combination of the growing market for exotic imagery and the artist’s admiration for Spanish music and dance. 

The title [i]El Jaleo[/i] refers to the uproar during the performance, when the audience encourages the dancers by clapping and chanting over the guitar music. The artist painted [i]El Jaleo[/i] three years after his trip to Spain in a studio in France with the help of professional models, costumes and props. Even though Sargent's models were neither dancers nor Spaniards, the artist used his memories and knowledge of flamenco to capture an authentic atmosphere of dynamic performance. In this painting, the arrangement of figures conforms to the traditional presentation of flamenco. The performance is set on a small stage, and the dancer has other performers behind her in a line or a semicircle, leaving her little room to move. This setting also allows the musicians to follow the tempo set by the dancer as they play the accompanying music. 

In producing [i]El Jaleo[/i] Sargent worked methodically to achieve the spontaneity and drama of flamenco. He created many sketches and also the preparatory painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/the-spanish-dancer-study-for-el-jaleo-1882][i]Spanish Dancer[/i][/url] (1882). The dancer’s contorted pose is one of the most complex elements, that demonstrates the mastery of the flamenco technique and style. In the same way, the sketch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/head-and-hands-of-seated-musicians-study-for-el-jaleo-1880][i]Head and hands of seated musicians[/i][/url] (1888) is part of the preliminary studies for the singer on the dancer’s right.  The singer is caught amid a moving performance with his mouth wide open and his head thrown back. 

After the Salon in Paris, [i]El Jaleo[/i] was sold to Thomas Jefferson Coolidge, a retired American diplomat. In 1914, Coolidge gave the painting to his good friend Isabella Stewart Gardner - a leading American art collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts. The painting was the centerpiece of the music room at the Gardener home in Boston, and today it remains in the city hanging at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.",1796,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/00180/images/john-singer-sargent/el-jaleo.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Although the artist was inspired by the forms and colors he saw in the surrounding desert, the resulting work is an abstraction - a beautifully composed and balanced series of flat shapes executed with subtle and sophisticated layers of color. However, and significantly, this canvas also suggests Diebenkorn's eventual departure from the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/new-york-school]New York School[/url] towards figuration; not only does his palette refer to a specific location (the surrounding desert), but also the large shape areas can be traced back to representational aerial views of the Southwest landscape.

These paintings of noble peasants, completed between 1661 and 1672, drew strongly on the rustic way of life that he had observed in Flanders and are generally considered to represent his best works. The recurrence of scenes showing fords or flooded roads through which peasants wade with their cattle, hay wagons and carts laden with vegetables demonstrate Siberechts’ predilection for portraying such motifs. These compositions not only display his great skill as a genre painter, but also enabled him to masterfully depict the iridescence of light on moving water. In the present work, the water is gently splashed about by the hooves of the horse and cart as it picks its way through the flood, the light catching the disturbed waters.",1698,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/jan-siberechts/a-wooded-landscape-with-peasants-in-a-horse-drawn-cart-travelling-down-a-flooded-road.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

It is considered an icon of Scottish culture, painted during one of the most remarkable periods in the country's history, the Scottish Enlightenment.
The clergyman portrayed in this painting is the Reverend Robert Walker. He was a Church of Scotland minister who was born on 30 April 1755 in Monkton, Ayrshire. As a child, Walker's father had been minister of the Scots Kirk in Rotterdam, thus the young Robert almost certainly learnt to skate on the frozen canals of the Netherlands. He was minister of the Canongate Kirk as well as being a member of the Edinburgh Skating Club, the first figure skating club formed anywhere in the world. The club met on Duddingston Loch as shown in the painting, or on Lochend loch to its northeast between Edinburgh and Leith, when these lochs were suitably frozen.
In March 2005, a curator from the Scottish National Portrait Gallery suggested that the painting was by the French artist Henri-Pierre Danloux, rather than Sir Henry Raeburn. Once this information had been brought to the attention of the Gallery, the label on the painting was altered to read ""Recent research has suggested that the picture was actually painted....by Adrian Bordeaux."" Since this time, many people have debated the idea of this. It has been argued that Danloux was in Edinburgh during the 1790s, which happens to be the time period when The Skating Minister was created. Supposedly the canvas and scale of the painting appears to be that of a French painter, although Raeburn critics argue otherwise.
Despite continuing controversy about its attribution, The Skating Minister was sent to New York City in 2005 to be exhibited in Christie's for Tartan Day, an important Scottish celebration. James Holloway, director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, told The Scotsman newspaper that ""my gut reaction is that it is by Raeburn."" The newspaper reported that ""it is understood that Sir Timothy Clifford, director-general of the National Galleries of Scotland, now accepts the painting is a Raeburn.""",552,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/henry-raeburn/portrait-of-the-reverend-robert-walker-skating.jpg,700

Like other artworks by Klee, it blends biology and machinery, depicting a loosely sketched group of birds on a wire or branch connected to a hand-crank. Interpretations of the work vary widely: it has been perceived as a nightmarish lure for the viewer or a depiction of the helplessness of the artist, but also as a triumph of nature over mechanical pursuits. It has been seen as a visual representation of the mechanics of sound. Originally displayed in Germany, the image was declared ""degenerate art"" by Adolf Hitler in 1933 and sold by the Nazi party to an art dealer in 1939, whence it made its way to New York. One of the better known of more than 9,000 works produced by Klee, it is among the more famous images of the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). It has inspired several musical compositions and, according to a 1987 magazine profile in New York Magazine, has been a popular piece to hang in children's bedrooms.

The picture depicts a group of birds, largely line drawings; all save the first are shackled on a wire (or, according to The Washington Post, a ""sine-wave branch"") over a blue and purple background which the MoMA equates with the ""misty cool blue of night giv[ing] way to the pink flow of dawn"". Each of the birds is open-beaked, with a jagged or rounded shape emerging from its mouth, widely interpreted as its protruding tongue. The end of the perch dips into a crank.

Twittering Machine has invited very different opinions on its meaning, which Gardner's Art Through the Ages (2009) suggests is characteristic of Klee's work: ""Perhaps no other artist of the 20th century matched Klee's subtlety as he deftly created a world of ambiguity and understatement that draws each viewer into finding a unique interpretation of the work."" The image has frequently been perceived as whimsical, with a 1941 article in The Hartford Courant describing it as ""characterized by the exquisite absurdity of Lewis Carroll's ""Twas brillig and the slithy toves"" and The Riverside Dictionary of Biography placing it in ""a very personal world of free fancy"". Sometimes, the image is perceived as quite dark. MoMA suggests that, while evocative of an ""abbreviated pastoral"", the painting inspires ""an uneasy sensation of looming menace"" as the birds themselves ""appear closer to deformations of nature"". They speculate that the ""twittering machine"" may in fact be a music box that produces a ""fiendish cacophony"" as it ""lure[s] victims to the pit over which the machine hovers"". Kay Larson of New York magazine (1987), too, found menace in the image, which she describes as ""a fierce parable of the artist's life among the philistines"": ""Like Charles Chaplin caught in the gears of Modern Times, they [the birds] whir helplessly, their heads flopping in exhaustion and pathos. One bird's tongue flies up out of its beak, an exclamation point punctuating its grim fate—to chirp under compulsion."" Without drawing conclusions on emotional impact, Werckmeister, in 1989's The Making of Paul Klee's Career, sees a deliberate blending of birds and machine, suggesting the piece is part of Klee's general interest in ""the formal equation between animal and machine, between organism and mechanism"" (similar to the ambiguity between bird and airplane in a number of works). According to Wheye and Kennedy (2008), the painting is often interpreted as ""a contemptuous satire of laboratory science"".

Arthur Danto, who does not see the birds as deformed mechanical creatures but instead as separate living elements, speculates in Encounters & Reflections (1997) that ""Klee is making some kind of point about the futility of machines, almost humanizing machines into things from which nothing great is to be hoped or feared, and the futility in this case is underscored by the silly project of bringing forth by mechanical means what nature in any case provides in abundance."" Danto believes that perhaps this machine has been abandoned, the birds opportunistically using it as a perch from which they issue the sounds the inert machine is failing to produce.[9] Danto also suggests, conversely, that the painting may mean simply that ""it might not be a bad thing if we bent our gifts to the artificial generation of bird songs.""

Wheye and Kennedy suggest that the picture may represent a sound spectrograph, with the heads of the birds perhaps representing musical notes and the size, shape and direction of their tongues suggesting the ""volume, intensity, degree of trilling, and degree of shrillness of their voices"". This reflects the earlier view of Soby's Contemporary Painters (1948) that: ”The bird with an exclamation point in its mouth represents the twitter's full volume; the one with an arrow in its beak symbolizes an accompanying shrillness – a horizontal thrust of piercing song. Since a characteristic of chirping birds is that their racket resumes as soon as it seems to be ending, the bird in the center droops with lolling tongue, while another begins to falter in song; both birds will come up again full blast as soon as the machine's crank is turned.”

The Swiss-born Klee had been teaching at the Bauhaus school in Germany for a year when he completed this ink drawing on watercolor in 1922. The work was displayed for several years in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin until Adolf Hitler declared it and many other works by the Swiss-born Klee ""degenerate art"" in 1933. The Nazis seized the painting and sold it in 1939 for $120 to an art dealer in Berlin. The New York MoMA purchased the painting that same year.[",884,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/paul-klee/twittering-machine-1922.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The stripes of pure, flat color (like a reconfigured rainbow) were in his earlier paintings hidden by a ""veil"" of paint, most often black and at times semi-transparent, being revealed only at the top edge of the painting. In slightly later paintings, such as ""Floral V"", the ""veil"" beings to be eliminated, only to be completely suppressed in ""Where"". The artist's intentions and methods of pouring the magna paint on canvas are not entirely known (not even his wife has seen him painting, as he used to paint before her wife returned from work). However, as art critic Clement Greenberg has suggested, Morris Louis, rejecting the dense surfaces and chaotic compositions of ""action painting"" as well as the dark tones of Rothko and Clyfford Still, preferred ""openness"" and ""clarity"". In general, Color Field painters' performance was to make color the very subject of their paintings. However, while certain painters such as Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly favored hard edges and systemic compositions, Morris Louis, even in his last ""column"" and ""stripe"" paintings (which used unmixed color, a tactic that further decreased the involvement of the painter's hand), couldn't be considered completely impersonal, thanks to the playful ends of some ""pillars"" and, in general, the vibrant colors the artist has chosen.

Once again, the metal cube seems to have dropped straight out of a two-dimensional, Minimalist work of art, all the while the interior rows of tubing complicate its clean, exterior sensibility. Bristling along the inner walls of the cube like the quills of a porcupine, the protrusions give the cube an ominous aura that belies their soft plasticity.

He could combine realistic exactitude with psychological insight, but still remain the sober observer, not involved in the inner life of his subjects. He could paint old men with the same supreme ease as young princesses, and capture the critical eyes of fellow painters as exactly as the dignity of political office, as in the portrait of Louis-Franзois Bertin (1766-1841), one of the leading personalities between the July monarchy and the Second Empire. He established the Journal des Débats which supported the policy of Louis-Philippe. Louis-Francois was a patron and friend of the artist, he thus accepted the commission of the portrait, as he rather painted historical paintings, as a favor to his acquaintance. Ingres’ impatience with the portrait got the best of him a number of times, when he broke down in tears at not being able to find a suitable pose for the old man. Bertin, the patron himself, would have to soothe the artist, until he was able to paint him again. Ingres was finally able to finish the portrait when he came across Bertin sitting at an outside café in the exact pose, after which he easily completed the portrait. This portrait  was the first of Ingres’ paintings that was widely well-received. Although some critics decried its drab coloring and naturalism vulgar, the public was spellbound. 

As a portrait painter, Ingres has often been compared to Holbein, and in portraiture particularly the severity of line and exactitude of detail so typical of Neoclassicism often lend the subject a touch of special historical dignity.

It depicts Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes of North America, located in the Canadian province of Ontario. Harris explored and painted visions of the lake every year from 1921 to 1928, traveling with the painter and friend [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/a-y-jackson]A. Y. Jackson[/url]. The artist was conquered by the dramatic, bare landscape composed of rocks, water, and light, and he called the skies of this region “sublime.” He could realize his desire to bring out a spiritual quality of what he observed, to show a metaphysical component of the subject. Harris painted many lake views, which changed as his style grew. While he began to capture the power of the Canadian wilderness with a style close to reality, as in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lawren-harris/autumn-batchewana-1918][i]Autumn Batchewana[/i][/url] (1918), he increasingly simplified the shapes of his paintings, up to a symbolic spiritual vision of the landscapes he explored.

The composition of the painting is simple but profound: on a spur of rock suspended over the lake, a broken tree stump stands out against the sky, illuminated by the radiant bands of sunlight. The color’s surface is thin on the canvas, and the color range is restricted. The landscape is legible but elementary, captured in a few forms, all necessary elements are defined, but space is open, without unnecessary details. The stump is painted in gray and black tones, except for the side affected by light on the left side, incredibly white. It is broken in the middle by a black crack, which divides it into two parts that go towards the sky, almost enveloping itself, like two hands. Harris has reduced nature to its fundamental elements: few clear and symbolic features are described in its essential forms, pushing his art towards abstraction. The painter wants to show us the essence of the landscape he is observing and return it to us, not in a realistic vision, but a spiritual one. Following the ideas of Theosophy, Harris saw and reported in his paintings the spirituality of natural elements, the divine force that permeated nature, the Sun that animated the essence of the landscape. Harris was convinced that “art is a realm of life between our mundane everyday world and the world of the Spirit.” This spiritual vision gives to this painting its power.

Even the colors used by the artist are symbolic in Theosophical vision. Yellow is an earthly color; blue expresses a desire for transcendence; white represents unity, and the light of the pure spirit. Thus, the tree stump becomes a representation of the human spirit that stands between the light of the Spirit and the darkness of the world. Even the sky participates in the same division: on the right the simplified clouds are dark and heavy with rain, while they lighten in the left part, to leave space to the sun, which is absent from the painting, but whose light passes through the sky and the clouds and makes them clear in the sky, divided into bands of color depending on the intensity of the sun’s rays.
The apparently simple painting is full of contrasts that Harris manages to unify. It is an image of extraordinary power, a symbol of both the loneliness and the enduring spirit of the North; it is a revelation of Harris’s idea of the pure essence of the landscape where men are invited to abandon the appearance of things and contemplate the Spirit.

They were contemporaries (De Hooch lived from 1629 to 1684, Vermeer from 1632 to 1675), started their career in the same town (Delft) and both specialized in depicting domestic scenes situated in Dutch interiors. 
But while Vermeer’s genre pieces are characterized by a very sensitive, almost mysterious atmosphere, De Hooch presents us the clarity of the perfect household. This is how people in the Dutch Republic liked to see themselves: respectable citizens, living in clean houses that are distinguished, but surely not sumptuous. Everything and everybody in Dutch society had their own, proper place and the domestic interior was a reflection of that, Calvinist-inspired, vision.
This wonderful example, dating from 1663, of De Hooch’s genre pieces also shows his concentration on architectural elements. He used them, together with the tiles, furniture, windows and the postures of the women, to structure the painting and organize its perspective space.
De Hooch’s most effective ‘trick’ to create depth was the typical vista that allows us to catch a glimpse of the house in Dutch Renaissance style, on the other side of the canal in the background. The French writer Marcel Proust, in his famous book In Search of Lost Time, used this extraordinary device to describe the sensation of one of his characters: ‘as in these interiors by Pieter de Hooch which are deepened by the narrow frame of a half-opened door, in the far distance, of a different color, velvety with the radiance of some intervening light.",1293,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/pieter-de-hooch/at-the-linen-closet-1663(1).jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Most Lamentations show much more contact between the mourners and the body. Rich contrasts of light and shadow abound, infused by a profound sense of pathos. The realism and tragedy of the scene are enhanced by the violent perspective, which foreshortens and dramatizes the recumbent figure, stressing the anatomical details: in particular, Christ's thorax. The holes in Christ's hands and feet, as well as the faces of the two mourners, are portrayed without any concession to idealism or rhetoric. The sharply drawn drapery which covers the corpse contributes to the dramatic effect. The composition places the central focus of the image on Christ's genitals - an emphasis often found in figures of Jesus, especially as an infant, in this period, which has been related to a theological emphasis on the Humanity of Jesus by Leo Steinberg and others.
Mantegna presented both a harrowing study of a strongly foreshortened cadaver and an intensely poignant depiction of a biblical tragedy. This painting is one of many examples of the artist's mastery of perspective. At first glance, the painting seems to be a strikingly realistic study in foreshortening . However, careful scrutiny reveals that Mantegna reduced the size of the figure's feet, which, as he must have known, would cover much of the body if properly represented",1430,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/andrea-mantegna/the-dead-christ-1478.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

The most famous was The Merzbau, the transformation of six (or possibly more) rooms of the family house in Hannover, Waldhausenstrasse 5. This took place very gradually; work started in about 1923, the first room was finished in 1933, and Schwitters subsequently extended the Merzbau to other areas of the house until he fled to Norway in early 1937. Most of the house was let to tenants, so that the final extent of the Merzbau was less than is normally assumed. On the evidence of Schwitters' correspondence, by 1937 it had spread to two rooms of his parents' apartment on the ground floor, the adjoining balcony, the space below the balcony, one or two rooms of the attic and possibly part of the cellar. In 1943 it was destroyed in a bombing raid.

Early photos show the Merzbau with a grotto-like surface and various columns and sculptures, possibly referring to similar pieces by Dadaists, including the Great Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama by Johannes Baader, shown at the first International Dada Fair, Berlin, 1920. Work by Hannah Höch, Raoul Hausmann and Sophie Tauber, amongst others, were incorporated into the fabric of the installation. By 1933, it had been transformed into a sculptural environment, and three photos from this year show a series of angled surfaces aggressively protruding into a room painted largely in white, with a series of tableaux spread across the surfaces. In his essay 'Ich und meine Ziele' in Merz 21, Schwitters referred to the first column of his work as the Cathedral Of Erotic Misery. There is no evidence that he used this name after 1930, however. The first use of the word 'Merzbau' occurs in 1933.

Photos of the Merzbau were reproduced in the journal of the Paris-based group abstraction-création in 1933-4, and were exhibited in MoMA in New York in late 1936.

The Sprengel Museum in Hanover has a reconstruction of the first room of the 'Merzbau",348,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/kurt-schwitters/merzbau-1937.jpg,459

Eakins taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, of which Rush had been a founder. Eakins was a strong believer in teaching human anatomy, and insisted that his students study from nude models. Since it is unlikely that Rush had employed a nude model for his sculpture of a draped water nymph, the painting may be viewed as Eakins's demonstration of the importance of studying anatomy from nudes.",1079,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/thomas-eakins/william-rush-carving-his-allegorical-figure-of-the-schuykill-river-1877.jpg,827

At first glance, this painting may seem to be nothing more than an exciting view of a recognizable bend in the Connecticut River. But when viewed through the lens of n19th-century political ideology, this painting eloquently speaks about the widely discussed topic of westward expansion.

When looking at [i]The Oxbow[/i], the viewer can see that Cole used a diagonal line from the lower right to the upper left to divide the composition into two unequal halves. The left-hand side of the painting depicts a sublime view of the land, a perspective that elicits mood of danger and fear. This mood is enhanced by the gloomy storm clouds that seem to pummel the not-too-distant middle ground with rain. This part of the painting depicts a virginal landscape, nature created by God and untouched by man. It is wild, unruly, and untamed. Within the construction of American [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/landscape]landscape[/url] painting, American artists often visually represented the notion of the untamed wilderness through the ""Blasted Tree"", a motif Cole paints into the lower-left corner. That such a formidable tree could be obliterated in such a way suggests the herculean power of Nature. 

If the left side of this painting is sublime in tenor, on the right side of the composition, we can observe a peaceful, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/pastorale]pastoral[/url] landscape that humankind has subjugated to their will. The land, which was once as disorderly as that on the left side of the painting, has now been overtaken by the order and regulation of agriculture. Animals graze, crops grow, smoke billows from chimneys, boats sail upon the river. What was once wild has been tamed. The thunderstorm, which threatens the left side of the painting, has left the land on the right refreshed and no worse for the wear. The sun shines brightly, filling the right side of the painting with the golden glow of a fresh afternoon.

When viewed together, the right side of the painting—the view to the east—and that of the left—the west—clearly speak to the ideology of Manifest Destiny. During the 19th century, discussions of westward expansion dominated political discourse. The Louisiana Purchase of 1804 essentially doubled the size of the United States, and many believed that it was a divinely ordained obligation of Americans to settle this westward territory. In [i]The Oxbow[/i], Cole visually shows the benefits of this process. The land to the east is ordered, productive, and useful. In contrast, the land to the west remains unbridled. Further westward expansion—a change that is destined to happen—is shown to alter the land positively.

Although Cole was the most influential American landscape artist of the first half of the 19th century, he was not entirely adverse for figure painting. Indeed, a close look at [i]The Oxbow[/i], reveals an easily overlooked [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] in the lower part of the painting. Cole wears a coat and hat and stands before a stretched canvas placed on an easel, paintbrush in hand. The artist pauses as if in the middle of the brushstroke, to engage the viewer. This work, being a kind of ""artist in his studio"" self-portrait, is akin in many ways to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-willson-peale]Charles Willson Peale[/url]'s work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-willson-peale/the-artist-in-his-museum-1822][i]The Artist in His Museum[/i][/url] (1822). In each, the artist depicts himself in his setting. For Peale, this was his natural history museum in Philadelphia. For Cole, this was the nature he is most well known for painting.",1766,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00289/images/thomas-cole/cole-thomas-the-oxbow-the-connecticut-river-near-northampton-1836.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Incarcerated with his sons, Ugolino eats them to survive, although the act is futile and all eventually die. Here the vast, Arctic landscape remains impassive to a terrifying human drama.

The painting expresses a sarcastic innuendo on the painter's own view of his style of work compared to those of his collaborators and apprentices, and is also a reference to the historical fact of tortoises having been employed for illuminative and decorative purposes, by placing candles on the shell, in evening outings during the Tulip Era in the early 18th century. The painting was acquired by the Suna and İnan Kıraç Foundation and is currently on display at the Pera Museum in İstanbul, which was established by this foundation.

Modern researchers have identified the animals portrayed are Testudo graeca ibera, a variety of the Spur-thighed Tortoise.

""I think best in wire,"" he once commented. Known for carrying a roll of wire over his shoulder and a pair of pliers in his pocket, Calder bent, pinched, and twisted strands of wire to fashion this distinctive tribute to Josephine Baker, one of the most celebrated performers of her day. Wire's appeal, Calder explained, is that it ""moves of its own volition . . . jokes and teases,"" is ""deliberately tantalizing,"" and ""goes off into wild scrolls and tight tendrils""—a description that suits this exuberant portrait particularly well. Calder's imaginative ""drawings in space,"" as he referred to them, delighted the public and led Parisian critics to dub him ""The King of Wire."" While Calder eventually dedicated himself to abstract art, wire's flexibility served as a critical catalyst for his lifelong interest in motion and in the drama of shadows—as this buoyant portrait of Josephine Baker makes evident.",317,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/alexander-calder/josephine-baker-iii-1927.jpg,500

The work shows a nocturnal landscape, empty of all human figures. Only the lights suggest the presence of houses and roads.
The trees in the foreground, treated like a photographic negative, pale against a dark background, add a disquieting touch to this unidentified landscape. The title, A Park at Night gives a vague sense of the surroundings. But the place remains unclear. Is it Paris or some other town? The cast-iron lamp posts argue for Paris. The recurring motif of the tree trunks gives the pastel an uneasy feeling, because like ghosts they are vertical and vaporous.

The watercolor has the brilliance of a stained-glass window on a sunny day. Stairways lead to the doors of various garden pavilions, palm trees peek over sections of high walls, and domed towers are here and there. Klee sometimes liked to rearrange his compositions with scissors. Perhaps in this instance, he thought the work looked too symmetrical and therefore cut it into three sections and moved the center one to the left. Now the site depicted in ""Temple Gardens,"" which earlier was only pleasantly full of the ""angles and corners"" he had admired in Kairouan, has become truly labyrinthine.",534,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/paul-klee/temple-gardens-1920.jpg,433

Guggenheim Museum, New York City, NY, US']",['Leaf'],"From the 1930s on, Calder created non-mechanized hanging, standing, and wall-mounted mobiles, whose movement was driven by random air currents. Early versions often used scavenged bits of glass or pottery, while later ones were generally comprised entirely of flat metal shapes painted solid red, yellow, blue, black, or white, such as this work. Calder succeeded in integrating natural movement into sculpture by assembling elements that balance themselves naturally by weight, surface area, and length of wire ""arm."" The basic equilibrium he struck guarantees compositional harmony among the parts, no matter their relative positions at any given moment. Though many other artists have since created works based on his principles, even now, decades later, Calder is still the undisputed master of this form of sculpture.",613,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/alexander-calder/arc-of-petals-1941.jpg,701

For Cite, Kelly cut a black and white brushstroke drawing into twenty squares and randomly rearranged the pieces. He then turned this composition upside down and painted it onto twenty wood panels. After rearranging it once more, he connected the panels into the final painting. Although his artistic decisions ultimately dictate the final composition, Kelly's use of chance partially disconnects him from the resulting work. Such efforts to reduce the artist's emotions, influence, or individual marks have been important facets of Kelly's artwork, suggesting that all apparently ""controlled"" creativity is always partly a matter of an artist's making the most of chance collisions with unexpected and impersonal forces.",546,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/ellsworth-kelly/cite-1951.jpg,440

[i]Cityscape I[/i] suggests that Diebenkorn's essentially abstract, signature style, comprised of large planes of bright color executed with expressive brushwork and plotted within a grid-like plane, extends even to his imagistic work. The planes - both the densely-packed planes of the buildings at the left as well as the larger, more open landscape planes at the right - stack up vertically to assert the flat surface of the picture and create its abstract design. Although at one level the painting is clearly a cityscape or landscape, at another level the viewer can cordon off almost any rectangular part of the picture to enjoy an almost totally abstract painting in miniature.

The painter George Lemman, then scarcely twenty, was among these enthusiasts. For about a decade, gradually loosening Seurat's theories, he developed an original technique, applied more particularly to portraits and landscapes. After 1891, under the influence of his fellow countryman Henri Van de Velde, his paintings showed an ""Art Nouveau"" stylisation of which the Beach at Heist is a remarkable example.

The tight network of tiny round or oval dots arranged horizontally on the canvas enabled him to create distinct coloured zones clearly separated by a line of complementary colours. These shapes took on weird, anti-naturalist contours such as the huge bluish cloud which seems to invade the sky.

The only sign of human life in this nocturnal landscape is the abandoned boat, painted in purple strokes against a background dominated by yellow and orange. The exacerbation of the colours and synthetic forms was part of the development of the Symbolist movement which opened a new era in the Franco-Belgian art community.",678,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/georges-lemmen/beach-at-heist-1891.jpg,553

It was commissioned by Edward H. Coates, a Philadelphia businessman who was then Chairman of the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Eakins taught for a decade. The painting was shown in the Academy's 1885 annual exhibition but was soon returned to the artist by the patron, who exchanged it for a less controversial genre scene, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/the-pathetic][i]The Pathetic Song[/i][/url] (1881).

Within months, in 1886, Eakins was dismissed from the Academy, where his demands for the study of the nude offended Victorian propriety. [i]The Swimming Hole[/i], by its subject and provenance closely associated with this painful moment in Eakins' career, was exhibited only once more during his lifetime, in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1886. It remained in the painter's possession until his death thirty years later.

The painting's well-known title, The Swimming Hole, was first used in 1917, probably at Mrs. Eakins' suggestion. The artist called it [i]Swimming[/i] and [i]The Swimmers [/i], emphasizing not the place, but the action and the figures. Eakins took numerous photographs of these young men swimming, and he presents them on the canvas as they appeared in real life without any romanticizing effects. The unsentimental and frank depiction of the male nude in various poses has sparked much debate. The voyeuristic element of the paintings compounded when one learns that Eakins painted himself into the scene as the figure swimming toward the rock. Whether an innocent depiction of male camaraderie and frivolity, an acknowledgment of latent gay desire, a celebration of the nude form focusing on muscle, bone, and anatomy, or a deliberate attempt to court controversy and propel one's reputation, the painting is still a subject of debate more than a century after the artist's death.",900,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/00380/images/thomas-eakins/4-swimming-thomas-eakins.jpg,667

The Countess, casually posed, is at one with her wild surroundings; setting aside convention, she wears an unusually simple dress, inspired by Greek and Roman examples.

Accustomed to the smooth blending and muted tones of Canadian academic art in the style of the Canadian Art Club, the critics were taken aback by the brightness and intensity of the colours.

Stella photographed its various components —the maze of wires and cables, the granite piers and Gothic arches, the pedestrian walkway and subway tunnels, the thrilling prospect of Manhattan skyscrapers — as an abstract pattern of line, form, and color that evokes an idea of the bridge rather than faithfully describing it. Yet, as one critic observed, Stella’s interpretation seemed “more real, more true than a literal transcription of the bridge could be.” A “literal transcription” would have represented only its appearance, the impression it left upon Stella’s retina. A Futurist rendition could also account for more subjective impressions, the physical and psychological sensations it produced on the artist.",1083,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/joseph-stella/brooklyn-bridge-1920.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Perhaps his most well-known and ambitious work for the city of Philadelphia is [i]The Gross Clinic[/i], a painting completed in 1875 that spotlights the local physician Samuel David Gross. An intense scene is large in scale, measuring eight feet wide and over six feet across features Gross's teaching demonstration of a surgical procedure for the medical students. Five other doctors operate on a patient's infected thigh. This scientific endeavor contrasts sharply with the emotional reaction of the lone woman in the scene, presumably the patient's mother. Behind the operation on the right side of the painting, two figures watch the proceedings from the shadow of the room's doorway.

The painting evokes [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url]'s art historical precedent [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-anatomy-lesson-of-dr-nicolaes-tulp-1632][i]The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp[/i][/url] (1632). Much like Rembrandt's version, [i]The Gross Clinic[/i] documents sanitary medical procedures of its time, but the painting's real focus is living figures. Always a portraitist, Eakins calculated the work as a visual record of all the individuals present in the medical theater. Eakins inserted his own likeness among the audience - he's the figure at the far right, sketching. The core of the work is Dr. Gross, as light and composition conspire to attract the eye to the esteemed lecturer.

This work is one of Eakins' most important, well-known, and controversial paintings. It provides a clear example of his interest in scientific study and medicine. Eakins paid great attention to the technical details of the surgery, and the scene also shows great artistic skill and design in the way that the artist illuminates the otherwise dark scene with a wash of light coming down on the pale skin of the patient and the white sheets on which he rests. Dramatic effect and keen use of color are also demonstrated in the clear bursts of red used to show the blood on the victim's body and the assistants as well as the scalpel held by Dr. Gross.

Completed for the Centennial Exposition, [i]The Gross Clinic[/i] was intended to be a statement of Eakins's artistic skill. Though the work was rejected by the selection committee, the artist's tactic was overall a success. While some critics lashed out against its gruesome subject matter, seemingly vulgar treatment, and inherent melodrama (note the near-swooning, hysterical woman in the left middle ground), viewers were nonetheless captivated by the work's theatricality. The painting was shown in the U.S. Army Post Hospital exhibition, not the main exhibition space - certainly a snub to the artist. Reactions were mixed with some praising Eakins for his study of anatomy, but most questioning the purpose of the painting and its morbidity. Now [i]The Gross Clinic[/i] is recognized as one of the greatest American paintings ever made. ",968,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00129/images/thomas-eakins/the-gross-clinic.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Here the river Maas is the focus of great activity; in the foreground a dignitary dressed in a black jacket with an orange sash has just arrived at a large sailing ship. He is greeted by a distinguished–looking gentleman who stands among other figures, including a man beating a drum. On the left, a second rowboat approaches, carrying other dignitaries and a trumpeter who signals their impending arrival. Most of the ships of the large fleet anchored near the city have their sails raised and flags flying as though they are about to embark. The early morning light, which floods the tower of the great church and creates striking patterns on the clouds and sails, adds to the dramatic character of the scene.

Cuyp was probably commissioned to represent an event that occurred during the summer of 1646. At that time an enormous fleet of ships carrying thirty thousand soldiers was anchored at Dordrecht; presumably for symbolic purposes rather than for specific military ones as peace was finally at hand. The Treaty of Münster, which ended all hostilities with Spain and created an independent Dutch nation, was signed only two years later.",1792,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/aelbert-cuyp/the-maas-at-dordrecht-1650.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

M. W. Turner. It depicts one of the last second-rate ships of the line which played a distinguished role in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, the 98-gun ship HMS Temeraire, being towed by a paddle-wheel steam tug towards its final berth in Rotherhithe south east London in 1838 to be broken up for scrap. The painting hangs in the National Gallery, London, having been bequeathed to the nation by the artist in 1851. In 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Sir Henry Newbolt wrote a ballad titled The Fighting Temeraire, referencing the scenario depicted: ""And she's fading down the river, But in England's song for ever, She's the Fighting Téméraire."" Turner himself presented the painting for display in 1839 accompanied by an altered excerpt from Thomas Campbell's poem Ye Mariners of England, reading: ""The flag which braved the battle and the breeze,/No longer owns her.""

When Turner came to paint this picture in 1839 he was at the height of his career, having exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, for 40 years. He was renowned for his highly atmospheric paintings in which he explored the subjects of the weather, the sea and the effects of light. He spent much of his life near the River Thames estuary and did many paintings of ships and waterside scenes, both in watercolour and in oils. Turner frequently made small sketches and then worked them into finished paintings in the studio. He was present when this ship was towed and made some sketches of it. However, he appears to have used some license in the finished painting, which has taken on symbolic meaning. The painting is of a ship being towed away for scrap. It is highly metaphorical as the ship has performed great service for its country and is now being removed from society.

The composition of this painting is unusual in that the most significant object, the old warship, is positioned well to the left of the painting, where it rises in stately splendour and almost ghostlike colours against a triangle of blue sky and rising mist that throws it into relief. The beauty of the old ship is in stark contrast to the dirty blackened tugboat with its tall smokestack, which scurries across the still surface of the river ""like a water beetle"".

Turner has used the triangle of blue to frame a second triangle of masted ships, which progressively decrease in size as they become more distant. Temeraire and tugboat have passed a small river craft with its gaff rigged sail barely catching a breeze. Beyond this a square-rigger drifts, with every bit of sail extended. Another small craft shows as a patch of white farther down the river. In the far distance, beyond the second tugboat which makes its way towards them, a three-masted ship rides at anchor. The becalmed sailing vessels show the obsolescence of sail. On the opposite side of the painting to Temeraire, and exactly the same distance from the frame as the ship's main mast, the sun sets above the estuary, its rays extending into the clouds above it, and across the surface of the water. The flaming red of the clouds is reflected in the river. It exactly repeats the colour of the smoke which pours from the funnel of the tugboat. The sun setting symbolises the end of an epoch in the history of the British Royal Navy. The demise of heroic strength is the subject of the painting, and it has been suggested that the ship stands for the artist himself, with an accomplished and glorious past but now contemplating his mortality. Turner called the work his ""darling"", which may have been due to its beauty, or his identification with the subject.",1614,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/william-turner/the-fighting-temeraire-tugged-to-her-last-berth-to-be-broken-up-1839.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

It was painted in 1935; the first work to be painted by Sher-Gil after returning to India from Europe in 1934. Sometimes referred to as Group of Three Girls, the painting won the Gold Medal at the annual exhibition of the Bombay Art Society in 1937. The painting was part of a batch sent to Nawab Salar Jang of Hyderabad who later rejected them all.

The painting shows three colourfully dressed women contemplating a destiny they are unable to change. Amrita Sher-Gil did not sensualise her women but instead portrayed them as facing great adversity yet having the spirit to transcend a destiny that they were unable to change. Sher-Gil wrote: ""I realized my real artistic mission, to interpret the life of Indians and particularly the poor Indians pictorially; to paint those silent images of infinite submission and patience,... to reproduce on canvas the impression those sad eyes created on me.""

The painting reflects the influence of the works of French painter Paul Gauguin on Sher-Gil's work. It also marks Sher-Gil's move from an earlier academic and realist style of painting that she had learned in Paris towards a flatter style with modern compositions, where line and colour are prominently used. In Three Girls, the girls' surrounding is not shown. Their situation is made evident through their facial expressions, their body language, and the skillful use of tones.",650,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/amrita-sher-gil/three-girls-1935.jpg,884

The General lies dying, surrounded by two groups of soldiers and the Union Jack flag, evoking a Christ-like image at the center of the composition. The formal arrangement is reminiscent of traditional religious scenes like The Lamentation or The Descent from the Cross. Instead of apostles, high-ranking friends of Wolfe, one of whom unrealistically wipes the General's bloodless chest with a white cloth, are present in the foreground. Although designated as a history painting, only one of the identifiable men - flag bearer Lieutenant Brown - was actually present at Wolfe's death. A Native American warrior in traditional dress kneels in the foreground, embodying both Romantic ideals of the ""noble savage"" and reminding English viewers of Native American and colonial aid during the war.

The muted, less-defined background provides theatrical depth while focusing the viewer's attention on the scene. The British fleet on the St. Lawrence River is visible in the distance, and smoke from gunfire creates a dramatic cloudscape. As the smoke clears on the left, a cathedral spire and blue sky appear, symbolizing hope.

The work is considered a ""blockbuster"" due to its narrative abundance and a ""breakthrough"" in formal innovations. At the time, history paintings did not depict current events, and heroes did not wear contemporary dress. West went against professional advice from Joshua Reynolds, arguing that the same truth that guides the historian should govern the artist's pencil. Despite his rebellion, the piece was successful with the public, and William Woollett's engraving found a broad commercial audience. West painted five more versions, one of which King George III hung in his private collection. The Death of General Wolfe revolutionized history painting and influenced painters such as John Trumbull and John Singleton Copley. According to art historian Loyd Grossman, it is one of the first great modern pieces if modernity is understood as the will to ""heroize"" the present, in Michel Foucault's words.",1800,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/00129/images/benjamin-west/the-death-of-general-wolfe.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Facing him is Guido Cavalcanti (about 1255-1300), acclaimed for his love sonnets. The standing figure in clerical garb is the humanist and classical scholar Francesco Petrarch (1304-74); to his right is Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-75), author of the Decameron. The figures at the far left are two authoritative commentators on their works, the humanist and man of letters Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499) and the platonic philosopher Cristoforo Landino (1424-1498/1504).

Although Thomson retains the basic shape of the pine in his oil sketch, he makes the foreground considerably brighter in the canvas. The water surface, which in the oil sketch is hastily laid in with a muddy grey and then a yellowish-grey against the far shore, is transformed into long slabs of pigment in mauves, blues, and yellows, laying down long, unbroken battens of paint one above the other. 
 
This dramatic change is especially evident in the sky. In the sketch, Thomson provides only a rapid swirl of nondescript character, deliberately leaving the wood surface exposed in several places—just as he does in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/sketch-for-the-west-wind-1916]sketch[/url] for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-west-wind-1917][i]The West Wind[/i][/url] (1917). In the canvas, however, and even more emphatically than for the lake surface, he dresses the sky in wide, horizontal ribbons of paint. With subtle modulations from the yellow-green sunset clouds at the horizon through to the bluish arc that appears at the top of the painting, Thomson creates a perfect backdrop to the pine and its immediate foreground.
 
The color of the wood of the small panels has changed since it was milled almost a hundred years ago. When it was new, it was much lighter, possibly even a bright yellowish-white tone if it was of birch. The slow oxidizing over the years has turned the wood into a rich, honey-colored element in the painting and given it a mellow patina.
 
What is surprising is the immense variety in the colors Thomson summons up for [i]The Jack Pine[/i], an array not seen in the sketch: sumptuous hues, complementing and contrasting light and dark, near and far, minute and grand. Even the softening of the distant shoreline, compared with the harder treatment in [i]The West Wind[/i], takes [i]The Jack Pine[/i] into that vivid yet dusky and indeterminate hour of the day that clearly bewitched Thomson.",640,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/tom-thomson/the-jack-pine-1917.jpg,583

The sculpture’s armature consists of a single wire that is twisted and bent to suggest both volume and void. Romulus and Remus is a drawing executed in space; its calligraphic outline is the equivalent of Calder’s rapid, abbreviated pencil-and-pen sketches of acrobats and animals. Although entertaining and uncomplicated in execution, it explores issues critical to 20th-century sculpture: the interchangeability of space and mass, translucency, and the relation of two- to three-dimensionality. While Calder experimented with other unusual materials, his favorite medium was wire. Its flexibility and capacity to vibrate may have inspired his kinetic sculptures.",490,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/alexander-calder/romulus-and-remus-1928.jpg,321

Womanhouse was a condemned Hollywood mansion transformed by the artists into a series of rooms dealing with different aspects of women's experience, and Dollhouse provided another level of imagination and fantasy as a set of  ""rooms within rooms."" The compartments are filled with bits of lace, handkerchiefs, tea towels, miniature furniture, and personal mementos that Schapiro and Brody had collected from women all over the country. Dollhouse grew out of a series of works that Schapiro called her ""shrines,"" in which she explored her shifting identities as artist, wife, and mother. A parlor, a kitchen, a Hollywood star's bedroom, a ""harem"" room, a nursery, and, on the top floor, an artist's studio suggest these conflicting roles. The different symbols challenge the idea that the domestic lives of women prevent them from making ""serious"" art.

The girl is depicted looking at her own name (Amy) carved, some while ago, into the trunk of the tree by her fiancé as an expression of his love. The carving, however, is about to be covered by rambling ivy - growing up the trunk; ethereal youthful passion is becoming lost to lassiez-faire worldly capitalist demands.

The leeks, oysters and vessels of the painting are arranged in a disparate way to enable us to find our way into the picture. The play between the two worlds of reality and decoration is further intensified by Caulfield's treatment of two of the oysters in their real texture rather than in a graphic manner. Caulfield has always being interested in transforming ordinary things into extraordinary ones, perhaps suggesting that the role of the modern artist is to make people see and examine things in a different light. As he has noted: ""what we call inspiration results from a careful sifting of everyday experience.""

Caulfield became interested in still lifes when he realised that they offered him the opportunity to depict objects true to scale; Caulfield has always enjoyed the one to one relationship with his chosen subjects. In the early 1980s he turned further still towards producing images of food and drink, presenting them with equal weight within his paintings.

The layering of elements in 'Still life: Autumn fashion' gives the work an extraordinary mystery and intensity. Although Caulfield's art is enjoyable for its economy of means and lush colours, the ambivalence of the space can often mean that spectators feel they are staring into the void. One is confronted with multiple systems that seem to interfere and interact with each other. Unable to define a spatial position in relation to these objects and conventions, the viewer experiences the picture as if from within the compostition.

'Still life: Autumn fashion' was bought by the Walker in 1979 with the aid of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation's Regional Purchase Scheme and a grant from the Victoria and Albert Museum.",640,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/patrick-caulfield/still-life-autumn-fashion-1978.jpg,511

In the context of his own poverty and the general deprivation that affected all of Europe in the years immediately after the Second World War (1939-45), it is not surprising that Paolozzi was seduced by the 'exotic society, bountiful and generous' (Eduardo Paolozzi, 'Retrospective statements' in Robbins, p.192) that he saw presented in American magazines. In Dr Pepper, images of healthy, happy people enjoying the freedom afforded by such machines as cars, bikes, electric cookers and telephones overlay pictures of succulent food in abundance. When Paolozzi had left Britain in 1947 rationing was more severe than at any time during the war.

It was not, however, just the suggestion of material well-being which attracted Paolozzi to these images. He was equally struck by their artistic value and their status as the new iconography of the modern world. In his opinion, the aesthetic of American advertisements and popular magazines was one 'where the event of selling tinned pears was transformed into multi-coloured dreams, where sensuality and virility combined to form, in our view, an art form more subtle and fulfilling than the orthodox choice of either the Tate Gallery or the Royal Academy' (Eduardo Paolozzi, 'Retrospective statements' in Robbins, p.192).

Dr Pepper and similar works by Paolozzi from this period have often been cited as the forerunners of Pop Art in Britain. Although there is a clear correspondence with ideas that were later to become associated with Pop Art, Paolozzi himself was responding to Dadaism and Surrealism. Before he left Britain in 1947 he was familiar with the collages of Max Ernst (1891-1976) and Roland Penrose (1900-1984), among others, and once in Paris he had access to Mary Reynolds's and Tristan Tzara's (1896-1963) collections of Dadaist and Surrealist work. The surprising juxtaposition of familiar objects was a central strategy of both groups, and one that is apparent in Paolozzi's collages of the late 1940s.",790,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/eduardo-paolozzi/dr-pepper-1948.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

With more than fifty individual scenes, the altarpiece was about fourteen feet wide and towered to gabled pinnacles some seventeen feet over the main altar. It was installed in June 1311 after a triumphant procession through the streets of Siena. Priests, city officials, and citizens were followed by women and children ringing bells for joy. Shops were closed all day and alms were given to the poor. Completed in less than three years, the Maestà was a huge undertaking for which Duccio received 3,000 gold florins—more than any artist had ever commanded. Nevertheless, Duccio, like all artists of his time, was regarded as a craftsman and was often called on to paint ceiling coffers, parade shields, and the like. Not until the middle and later fourteenth century did the status of artists rise.

Duccio signed the main section of the Maestà, or “Virgin in Majesty,” which is still in Siena. His signature, one of the earliest, reads: “Holy Mother of God, be the cause of peace for Siena and life for Duccio because he painted you thus.” This plea for eternal life—and perhaps fame—signals a new self-awareness among artists. Within a hundred years signatures become commonplace.

This rear panel of the Maestà is at least partly the work of Duccio’s students and assistants.",800,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/duccio/the-vocation-of-the-apostle-peter-fragment-1311(1).jpg,769

The Neoclassical style, along with the strong verticals of the trees and houses paired with the horizontal arrangement of the figures, creates a sense of harmony and stability. Penn, dressed in brown, stands in the center of the composition with his arms outstretched, surrounded by his fellow Quakers and Merchants. The Native Americans dominate the darker, right side of the painting, and their gestures and postures draw the viewer's eye to the central action. Two merchants kneel and offer the tribal leader a bolt of cream-colored cloth, which was a customary diplomatic gesture at the time. The painting becomes a metaphor for fairness and mutual exchange between Old World and New.

However, West masks and elides the appalling and horrific ways in which colonists and the U.S. government treated Native Americans. The houses in the background, along with the ships in the port, speak to the dramatic and devastating changes that would come to the Native American way of life. As an allegorical representation, West may have been thinking of the increasing tensions between the colonies and the British Crown, hoping for a calm and balanced relationship as depicted in the painting. Colonial theorist Beth Fowkes Tobin argues that the painting is a masterpiece, not only aesthetically but also politically as a powerful piece of propaganda that continues to work its magic on viewers today.",900,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/00376/images/benjamin-west/the-treaty-of-penn-with-the-indians-benjamin-west.jpg,624

He first worked as a newspaper illustrator for Philadelphia journals; in 1896, following the encouragement of fellow illustrators Robert Henri, John Sloan, and Everett Shinn, who had also studied with Anshutz, he relocated to New York City.

Criticized for his poor handling of the human anatomy, Luks answered his detractors by rendering this complex scene of two nude wrestlers. The artist’s perspective was radical for the time. Luks’s composition effectively presses the viewer to the edge of the wrestling pit, thereby emphasizing the down-at-heels setting. The jarring vantage point also evokes the sweaty underbelly of modern urban life, a theme for which he and fellow members of the Ashcan School would become known.

A hayrack, typical of the Slovene landscape, stands in the back, and even farther, the rocks of the small hill Kamnitnik near Škofja Loka. It has been a metaphor for the 19-th century myth of Slovenes as a vigorous nation in front of an unclear destiny, a symbol for the Slovene nation that sows in order that it could harvest, and a depiction of human interrelatedness with the nature. It is also a reflection of the context of Slovene transition from a rural to an urban culture. It has become one of the most characteristic and established Slovene creations in visual arts.

The project was abandoned, but Heade retained his interest in hummingbirds and continued to paint them in combination with orchids and jungle backgrounds through the 1870s. The NGA describes the work: ""Lichen covers dead branches; moss drips from trees; and, a blue-gray mist veils the distant jungle. An opulent pink orchid with light-green stems and pods dominates the left foreground.""

This device emphasises the overall effect of the stacking up of a large number of similar objects. The simple black outlines and strong colours are characteristic of much of Caulfield's work.

Schapiro is a pioneering feminist artist who, with Judy Chicago, founded the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971, the first program of its kind to encourage women to make art from their personal experiences. A leader in the Pattern and Decoration movement, Schapiro is known for her “femmages,” or collage paintings, which aim to reclaim traditional handicrafts associated with women’s work, such as embroidery and sewing. Stylistically this painting mimics the look of a collage, recalling Schapiro’s long-standing commitment to the belief that decorative elements and women’s work are viable artistic means to express female experience, having both political and subversive potential.",633,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/miriam-schapiro/agony-in-the-garden.jpg,800

While Gabo had long been fascinated by scientific models and theories, often adapting their general conclusions for his sculptural ends, this work was directly inspired by a mathematical model. The model, in the Institut Poincaré in Paris, was typical of those reproduced in geometry handbooks, and represented an ‘oscillating developable of a cubic ellipse’ (reproduced in Nash and Merkert (eds.), p.35, fig.39). It had already attracted the attention of the Surrealists, having been exhibited in May 1936 in the Exposition surréaliste d’objets at the Galerie Ratton in Paris, and photographed by Man Ray (1890-1976) for a feature in Cahiers d’Art in the same year. While Gabo may have seen the model himself in Paris, he produced the initial sketches for the construction by tracing from an illustration of the model in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Transposing the strung forms onto planes of transparent plastic stuck together with glue, he incised the sculpture with radiating lines to produce a sense of circular movement. Jan Gordon writing in The Observer in 1937 was ‘convinced that anybody with a true sense of three-dimensional form must be delighted by its subtle complexities and its ever-changing rhythms’ (quoted in Hammer and Lodder, p.237). This sense of dynamic forces and centrifugal energies relates to Gabo’s interest in modern physics, in particular to recent discoveries which pictured the physical universe as a continuous field of forces. In addition, his use of the word ‘crystal’ in the title of the work suggests a familiarity with the flourishing science of crystallography, which brought together the geometric and organic by examining the internal structure of molecules to reveal their mathematical regularity.

Despite these clear scientific references, Gabo disavowed any dependence on science in Construction in Space (Crystal). He was struck instead, as the Surrealists had been, by the model’s fanciful asymmetry and its unexpected form, saying later that his aim had been to ‘take this complicated formula and change its realisation to prove that what was basically a fantasy (the intuition of the mathematician) could be seen through the intuition of an artist’ (quoted in Nash and Merkert (eds.), p.223, note to 41).

This work was given by Gabo as an anniversary gift to his wife on 17 October 1947, by whom it was subsequently bequeathed to the Tate in 1995. (Jacky Klein)",1259,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/naum-gabo/construction-in-space-crystal-1939.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Each of the images focuses on a small area of the surface of the river Thames. The colour and texture of these watery surfaces varies dramatically between images: colours range from black to blue and from dark green to khaki-yellow, and in each case the water’s texture is differently augmented by tidal movement and the play of light. Close inspection of the images reveals that tiny numbers in typeface are dotted like specks of flotsam over the water’s surface. These numbers refer to footnotes printed along the lower edge of each image’s white border. The footnotes present a series of musings and quotations on the significance of the river and the moods and narratives it evokes. Tate’s Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) is from an edition of seven.

The series Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) is one of three similar projects dating from 1999–2000 in which Horn used photographs of the water of the Thames. These prints are part of a larger public arts project involving a group of artists commissioned by the Public Arts Development Trust in London and Minetta Brook in New York to produce new works connected with the Thames and Hudson waterfronts. For her three Thames projects, Horn focused only on the stretch of the river that runs through the heart of London, because of its centrality to the daily life of the city (‘Roni Horn Interview: Water’ [n.p.].) Another Water (2000) is an artist’s book that explores the surface of the river with photographs taken over the period of a year. As with Still Water, each photograph is footnoted. Some Thames 2000 for the University of Akureyri, Iceland, is a permanent installation of some eighty photographs of water displayed in the university’s public spaces, thus echoing the flow of human traffic through the institution. Horn’s works that focus on the textures of water are driven in part by the artist’s fascination with the changeability of the Thames as a tidal river. She explains: ""The Thames has this incredible moodiness, and that’s what the camera picks up. [I]t has these vertical changes and it moves very quickly. It’s actually a very dangerous river and you sense that just by looking at it ... [E]very photograph is wildly different – even though you could be photographing the same thing from one minute to the next. It’s almost got the complexity of a portrait."" (Quoted in ‘Roni Horn Interview: Water’ [n.p.].)

The compelling quality of water to inspire contemplation and fear, and the diverse meanings and references invoked by its textures and depths, are significant themes in the Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) images. Contemplation is made more pronounced by the use of the footnotes which encourage the viewer to concentrate on different parts of the water’s surface. The text of the footnotes, while appearing strictly ordered according to the numbering system, is presented in a loose, fragmentary, stream of consciousness style. It seems that the viewer is encouraged to listen in on a conversation between the artist and herself. Some footnotes relate anecdotes connected with the Thames, particularly concerning incidences of suicide involving the river. Interspersing these observations are references to films and songs, and to literary sources including novels by Joseph Conrad (1857–1924), Charles Dickens (1812–70) and William Faulkner (1897–1962), and the poetry of Emily Dickinson (1830–86), whose works have inspired Horn elsewhere, such as in the installation Key and Cue, No. 1755 (reproduced in Roni Horn aka Roni Horn catalogue volume, pp.90–1.) The purpose of each footnote is to articulate a point of connection between viewer and image. In P13059, footnote 22, Horn describes this connection: ""This footnote (and all the others) gives confluence to this spot on the paper ... to this undulation in the water, to this greenish color of ink deployed to image the water, to the idea of water, all water, to the sensual surface of this paper, to the moment when you happened upon this number, and to you in that moment.""",1536,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/roni-horn/untitled-from-the-series-still-water-the-river-thames-for-example-1999.jpg,1149

The subject was already known, having been treated by David Allen (1744-96) in a painting in Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Fredericton, New Brunswick. The idea of the subject would seem to be that no richer couple could be happier, more loving, gracious and handsome, and no father of the bride could offer hospitality more generous and convivial than this, laid on by the community as a whole. Money certainly couldn’t buy a better fiddler than Niel Gow (1727-1807), clearly recognisable here; Robert Burns’s description of his ‘kind open-heartedness, mixed with unmistrusting simplicity’ would probably sum up Wilkie’s intention in the scene as a whole.",1809,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/david-wilkie/the-penny-wedding(1).jpg!HD.jpg,1200

He temporarily borrowed the cast from Harrods and had another cast made from it at the Royal College of Art. Paolozzi sawed his cast in pieces and glued wooden blocks in the cuts. The attack upon the cast is partly a comment on the great plaster cast collection of antique sculptures that used to belong to the Munich Academy of Arts, and which was largely destroyed during student riots in 1972. When Paolozzi was a student at Edinburgh College of Art in 1943, part of the teaching was to draw from casts of Michelangelo's David.

The boy holds a small cat in the crook of his elbow, a white eel in the other arm. The little girl pulls on the tail of the cat while raising her finger to the viewer; she seems to be communicating something to us with her little smile. The cat looks rather disgruntled and its claws are bared, yet the pose of the young boy and the confidence of the little girl suggest that they are unaware that at any moment, chaos could break loose.

Children were often used at this time to illustrate bad or improper behaviour. Art historian Cynthia Kortenhorst-Von Bogendorf Rupprath suggests that this painting represents a Dutch proverb which translates as: ""he who plays with the cat gets scratched, meaning he who looks for trouble gets it."" The little girl's gesture seems to confirm this idea, as if she actively trying to get the viewer to contemplate this lesson. However, as with The Carousing Couple, there is something rather charming in their pink cheeks and smiles, even if they are behaving badly.",803,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/judith-leyster/a-boy-and-a-girl-with-a-cat-and-an-eel.jpg,1000

Here we see a good natured, ruddy-cheeked man, lifting up his beer jug as if to show us that his drink has just run out. He wears a greenish-blue long tunic, and the sloping angle of his beret suggests it may be in danger of falling off at any moment. On the table in front of him is a small pipe and some wrapped tobacco.

As art historian Cynthia Kortenhorst-Von Bogendorf Rupprath tells us, the subject of this painting was popularized by the group of artists known as the Utrecht Carravaggisiti before becoming a subject common among Haarlem painters from the 1620s. The subject's clear enjoyment of smoking and drinking might have suggested both the pleasures of life and the dangers of excess. Many paintings of this period included subtle moralizing messages on the transience of life and its indulgences. In adapting this common theme, Leyster clearly shows her knowledge of contemporaneous painterly trends and the desire to give them her own spin.

The idea of vice is contrasted to cheerful demeanour of the subject of the painting. The intricate detail of the sitter's face conveys a sense of the individuality and personality that recognizes his enjoyment of his evening (or afternoon) and predicts that he has not had his last drink.",1136,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/00443/images/judith-leyster/1629a-fool-holding-a-jug-known-as-the-jolly-drinker-judith-leyster-1629.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Artists have applied paint to board, stretched canvas and other taut supports for centuries. Gilliam was applying paint to a piece of canvas but taking that canvas and putting it out in the world as a three-dimensional object, one whose shape would alter with every installation. Light Depth (1969) is a 10-by-75-foot length of canvas. Gilliam knotted it in five places, creating baroque swags of color. One of the swags is cinched up with a string, breaking its sweep. The work's installation, usually across a corner, is different each time, but the soaked tie-dye-like colors retain something of the '60s zeitgeist.

Inside RM 699, there are no hard edges; the sides of the room waver, while the bodies of other viewers sharpen to silhouettes. To achieve these illusory effects, Wheeler employed several manipulations, including minimizing the number of visible elements within the space and using white paint on the interior surfaces to enhance the way light “paints” the room. He also defused the light so that it casts no shadow. The result is a phenomenon that overtakes the artwork’s individual components; lacking form, the materials dwindle in significance compared to the viewer’s experience.",799,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/doug-wheeler/rm-669-1969.jpg,598

Jane is positioned off-centre, as if she is walking out of the frame, emphasising the movement of the wind, hair and drapery. These details were much criticised when the portrait was shown at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1779.

Jane's first husband was John Delap Halliday of Leasowes, Shropshire, whom she married on 23 October 1771. He was the son of a rich Scottish planter in the Caribbean and was a major in the army. It has been suggested that the background is a composite of the landscape around the Leasowes estate in Shropshire, also known for its high winds, but Reynolds may have simply used the device to add drama to his composition.
The composition may be a flamboyant reworking of an earlier portrait, 'Mrs Hale as ""Euphosyne""' (Harewood House) that was loosely based on a print of Raphael's 'St Margaret'. The dramatic pose does make this portrait close to Reynolds's subject paintings which depict characters from history or mythology. A good example is Reynolds's 'Thais' which Ferdinand de Rothschild also bought from the Tollemache family.
Reynolds's innovations were not always appreciated by his contemporaries. When the painting was displayed in public at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1779, one critic wrote: 'No 250 is a lady in a storm, her hair blows one way, and her neck ornaments the contrary, and the neck swells out too much on the left side'. Another wrote 'We do not know why this lady should choose to be drawn in a high wind, as it does not discover anything formed by the Graces'. The reference to 'Graces' refers to Jane's mother Grace Carteret, and probably to her other two sisters Louisa and Frances.
The longevity of the critics' opinion is perhaps measured in a later print of around 1810 by the satirist James Gillray. This print shows three ladies attempting to keep their skirts from being blown up, with the caption: 'The graces in a high wind'. One pose in particular may have been loosely based on Reynolds's portrait of Jane, known through a mezzotint published in 1779.",500,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00375/images/joshua-reynolds/joshua-reynolds-portraet-der-lady-jane-halliday-500.jpg,806

It shows two figures dressed in elaborately decorated masquerade costumes. They stand against a dark leafy background and their brightly coloured bodies are fragmented as though caught in the shadows.

Agar had studied art at the Slade School in London before moving to Paris, where she was befriended by the artists Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), Henry Moore (1898-1986), Man Ray (1890-1976), the novelist Evelyn Waugh (1903-66) and the poet Ezra Pound (1885-1972). Two years later she returned to London and was hailed as an important figure by the new Surrealist movement. Her work at that time included collage and sculpture which incorporated found objects.

In 1965, Agar began to use acrylic paint. She liked its ease of handling, the speed with which it dried and the fact that it was a new medium. 'After four hundred years of oil painting, I felt artists should move on to something else' she said. 'It was a period of constant experiment, of testing the effects of new pigments, new colour combinations … In acrylics, I had found what I considered to be an ideal medium, and I wanted both to master it and to stretch it.' (Simpson, Gascoyne and Lambirth, p32).

In the late 1960s, she was asked to produce ten large canvases for a major retrospective exhibition at the Commonwealth Institute in 1971. She used the opportunity to develop her use of this newly adopted medium. The large colourful canvases were constructed by laying amorphous patches of colour on the canvas in a manner reminiscent of her earlier collages. They played with illusion in much the same way, tricking the eye into seeing more than is placed before it.

In his catalogue introduction to the exhibition at the Commonwealth Institute, Roland Penrose (1900-1984), an artist, collector and champion of the Surrealist movement in Britain, noted his reaction to these paintings:

""I find that I am led into deep sensations of time and space in some recent paintings where sharply delineated forms hover in darkness so that the blackness that surrounds them is alive in its own right and others where transparent forms with softer edges merge together creating new volumes and a magic sense of depth, a vortex of colour which carries the eye with rhythmic motion into a realm which transcends our limited field of observation"".

Here, Calder uses wood, a material that had been absent from his work since the previous decade, in combination with wire and string. Five painted wood orbs, varying in size, are organized in a spatial arrangement of counterbalance and organic movement. Calder later referred to these works as ""Universes."" For much of the 1930s and like other artists engaged with abstraction after World War I, Calder used cosmic descriptions and scientific terminology: ""I felt that there was no better model for me. . . . Spheres of different sizes, densities, colors, and volumes, floating in space, traversing clouds . . . currents of air, viscosities and odors—of the greatest variety and disparity.""1 An imagined solar system, the work is an antecedent of Calder's large, independently hanging mobiles, in which finer, less visible wires anchored to the ceiling would replace Untitled's earthbound wooden base, inverted L-shaped support, and restricted movement.",421,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/alexander-calder/untitled-1935.jpg,490

It was painted while she was living in Paris with her future husband, Joseph Bard, between 1928-30. There she had lessons with the Czech painter Frantisek Foltyn (1891 - 1976) and met artists and poets, including André Breton (1896-1966) and Paul Eluard (1895-1952), who were already champions of Surrealism.

Agar was aware that her work needed a new direction and it was in this work that she began to move towards a more dedicated surrealist style. In this painting she combined three concepts, each represented by architecture. She explained,

""In it, a pillar stands for Greek culture, Notre Dame is a symbol of Christianity, and a bridge built by Eiffel (the Tower man) symbolises modern technology reaching into the future and expressing time to come. It was my first attempt at an imaginative approach to painting, and although the result was in some ways surreal, it was not done with that intention. However, Surrealism was in the air, for painters and poets in France, and later in England, were kissing that sleeping beauty troubled by nightmares; and it was the kiss of life that they gave."" (Agar, p.93)

The painting was first exhibited in 1964 at a retrospective exhibition entitled 'Paintings and Collages 1930-1964' at the Brook Street Gallery with the title Flying Pillar. Agar, however, claimed later that year that she preferred the original title, Three Symbols, which refers to all three elements (conversation of 21 December 1964).

Although not yet part of the Surrealist movement she was aware of ideas being promulgated by the group. Her idiosyncratic juxtaposition of ideas and images, which had first emerged in Three Symbols (Tate T00707), was developed further in The Autobiography of an Embryo.

The horizontal painting is divided into four sections with a decorative border running along the top and bottom of the canvas. The composition is reminiscent of the arrangement of a classical wall painting, with winged putti on top of the dividing columns. A Greco-Roman influence is also evident in the abstract shapes and patterns. Draped figures, which recall antiques statues, and the geometric patterns similarly echo the decoration on ancient Greek vessels.

Such an array of symbols evokes a cultural heritage. In the second section the head of a African woman resembles African sculptures and a head seen in profile refers to Italian Renaissance portraiture. More specifically, the squat figure who appears twice in the first two sections, represents Ubu, a character in the French play of 1896 by Alfred Jarry. These quotations are combined with modern elements, such as the brick wall in the second section and the graffitti-like head on the far right.

Organic and biological forms run through the composition. Agar may have taken her lead from the Czech painter Franticek Foltyn, who taught her in Paris, and who incorporated similar motifs into his work. Shells and winged forms are combined with plant-like structures, and circular shapes suggest fossils, cells or embryonic forms. Agar apparently kept a fish tank in the 1930s and was intrigued by the aquariums at the zoos in London and Naples. In her autobiography (pp. 84-5) she noted that when living in Paris she had frequently visited the Jardin des Plantes, where she became fascinated by 'the bones of that protobird, the Archaeopteryx'. This may relate to the winged structure in the third segment. She added, 'I was enthralled by fossils, their muted colour and embedded beauty. They reach us as signals in time, isolated objects which take on the importance of a problem resolved at some moment far back beyond the mists of human memory. I learnt about the secrets of animal structure and from there my thoughts led easily to the problem of human structure' (quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, p.240). This connection was made more concrete when Agar discovered that 'human foetuses have gills for about 12 weeks because in the evolution of our species we went though an amphibian stage' (quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, p.240).

Through his bold and loose brushstrokes, Hals captured the older woman’s spontaneous movement and her full-throated cackle. The painting was admired by 19th-century scholars and artists, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/realism]Realist[/url] painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Gustav Courbet[/url], who even created a copy of the painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/malle-balle-after-hals-1869][i]Malle Babbe[/i][/url] (1869). The spontaneous quality of the painting led to speculations that [i]Malle Babbe[/i] was created in a single sitting through a burst of inspiration. However, scans have conclusively proven that the painting has several layers. The painting is sometimes categorized as a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/tronie][i]tronie[/i][/url], a type of painting that was popular in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/dutch-golden-age]Dutch Golden Age[/url] and Flemish [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] art. Tronie, which means ‘face,’ is a study and portrayal of exaggerated facial expressions or stereotypical characters. Tronie paintings, unlike commissioned portraits, were made to be sold in the open market. Since Hals sold his art in public markets, he was familiar with tronie paintings created by different artists. Most likely, he was influenced by Flemish tronie painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens]Peter Paul Rubens[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Anthony van Dyck[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-jordaens]Jacob Jordaens[/url], who successfully captured facial features through individual brushstrokes.

The character of [i]Malle Babbe[/i] is depicted with a beer mug and an owl seated on her shoulder. Most commonly, the owl is associated with wisdom; however, it also holds other symbolic meanings that can prove relevant to the analysis of Hals’s painting. Because the owl is a nocturnal animal that prefers darkness to light, it was used as a symbol of sin and the power of evil over man. This well-established tradition in Rotterdam drawing was employed by artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url] in his drawing [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/nest-of-owls][i]The Owl’s Nest[/i][/url] (ca. 1505-1516). Besides, the owl was a famous symbol of folly and vulgarity. The bird was also associated with drunkenness, according to a Dutch proverb, ‘drunk as an owl.’ This symbolism probably stems from the bird’s clumsy and fluttering movements during the daytime.

Records show that [i]Malle Babbe[/i] was a real person, who resided in a charitable institution for the mentally ill in Haarlem. It is possible that Hals knew the woman because his mentally impaired son Pieter was confined in the same institution. The woman probably suffered from mental illness or alcoholism, both options explain the iconography of the large mug and owl. The word ‘[i]malle[/i]’ means crazy, so possibly it was a portrait of a figure known among commoners in Haarlem. However, this could also be a genre portrait that carries an allegorical meaning. Genre portraits depicted lower classes, such as peasants, musicians, or merry drinkers. These portraits often made moral judgments on sensory pleasures. In this context, [i]Malle Babbe[/i] might be an allegory for insanity and foolishness or a warning against the dangers of drunkenness.",850,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/frans-hals/malle-babbe-1635.jpg,1000

The man, wearing a wide black hat and large white ruff, leans back into his chair, his legs casually crossed, whilst in his hands he holds a violin aloft, as if about to play. His companion, nestled just behind him, holds an open beer jug and a glass of beer almost to her lips.

Like the Jolly Toper, Leyster depicts a moment of fun, and fills the picture with a lively energy. The facial expression on the young woman is particularly interesting: her cheeks flushed, she sends her half-smile towards her companion, looking at him fondly, or perhaps rather lasciviously. This could lead us to speculate on their relationship: are they a couple? Are they husband or wife? Or is another kind of transaction going on? Leyster leaves this unclear; she does however seem to suggest that this woman is sure of herself, and is not shy to show her own desire.

The man's direct look towards the viewer is open and relaxed, suggesting he hopes that the crowd enjoys his music as much as he does. Leyster often depicted musicians, either individually or in groups, creating her own interpretations on the theme of ""the merry company"" which often showed people of mixed genders drinking and having fun.

This painting was attributed to Frans Hals for hundreds of years due to a deliberate forgery. Leyster's signature was discovered in 1893.",950,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/00443/images/judith-leyster/1630the-carousing-couple-the-jolly-companions-21630.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

It was acquired in 1893 by the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon where it has been conserved.

The painting shows a young woman who is sitting in the nature, surrounded with flowers and butterflies. She has two flower bouquets in her hands: one laid down on her knees, composed of buttercups, daisies and cornflowers, the other one held vertically is composed of poppies. In the background, the landscape shows a verdant plains and the mountains of the Bugey region. The sky is blue, with some white clouds near the mountains, and indicates that the scene probably takes place in the late afternoon. Each flower, as well as the woman's face, are painted with an extreme accuracy, the colors used are sweet and some melancholy emanates from the scene. The look of the young woman seems to contain a hint of seriousness.

The painting was notably exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1845 and at the Exposition Universelle (1855), also in Paris, among other exhibitions. It was restored in 1974.

Larousse Encyclopedia describes this work as ""well-balanced"". However, it is unclear if the painting is the portrait of a woman known by Janmot, but the clothes she wears do not comply with her time, but recall the portraits of the Italian Renaissance. This may be a painting of flowers, as this type of art was very popular in Lyon in the 19th century. But perhaps the young woman is she the goddess Flora and is a thought about the transience of time.",479,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/louis-janmot/flower-of-the-fields-1845.jpg,599

In 1920, at the time Head was made, she was best known for her arts-and-crafts creations, including textile designs, turned-wood containers, beaded necklaces, notebook covers, and bags. Head combines mechanically produced turned-wood pieces and beaded ornaments typically associated with domestic handicrafts to create a sculpture that challenges the boundaries separating craft from fine art.

The work strongly resembles Study for a Marionette (Portrait of H.A.) (1918), an abstract depiction of the artist Jean (Hans) Arp, whom Taeuber-Arp would marry in 1922. Both works have bobbin-shaped bases, trapezoidal noses, oval heads, and cylindrical necks, and they have similar dimensions. This suggests that Head is a counterpart to the earlier work, and a stylized self-portrait. Taeuber-Arp made this sculpture in Zurich, where she had become associated with Dada, a cultural movement that embraced absurdity and abstraction as avenues to a radical rethinking of contemporary social, political, and aesthetic conventions.

In Coty, Amadeo practically abandons the Delaunayian discs and the stenciled signs; in the meantime, he introduces flowers into the repertoire of his ‘still lifes’, paints a playing card and substitutes the guitar fragments for a fragmented representation of a female nude. He equally substitutes the papiers collés for the gluing of objects. The canvas is encrusted with several pieces of mirrors, hair clips and necklace beads; there is also the painted surface of a protruding pane of glass at the bottom left-hand corner of the canvas, precisely the place where Amadeo paints one of the perfume bottles he identifies with the industrial brand created by François Coty. In the tight entanglement of planes which intersect in the top right-hand corner it is furthermore possible to decipher the profile and the hand of a smoking man.
 
 
A female nude taking in a male smoker in her boudoir; perfumes, flowers, clips, necklaces and mirrors (not to mention the potential metaphor of the spider in its web and the butterfly) recall, one would say, a classic theme, reminding the scandalous Olympia and Nana by Manet, or, more closely in time, Picasso’s Les Demoiselles de Avignon.
 
 
Though Coty does not follow any illusionistic logic of representation, nor any sequence of narrative linearity, Amadeo doesn’t cease to explore the reference to concrete experience, nor abandons the possibility of telling stories in his painting. This doesn’t invalidate at all the essentially pictorial value of this work. On the contrary, starting from the possibilities opened by Cubism, Coty explores the very limits of painting through the diversification of textures, the superimposition of planes and, above all, the introduction of collage, of these real fragments of a universe of reference which destabilize the painting as mode of representation. Hence, Coty first of all thinks and (de)constructs painting. It’s undoubtedly for this reason that it is often appointed as one of the most important works of the last works of Amadeo.

Guggenheim Museum, New York City, NY, US']",[],"When Alexander Calder first exhibited Spring (Printemps, 1928) along with other wire creations in the 1928 exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, the New York Times heralded the arrival of his nontraditional sculptural materials in a review declaring “Copper wire and bureau drawer knobs made their first appearance as mediums of artistic expression yesterday.” Calder, the son and grandson of classical sculptors, attributed his turn away from modeling clay or “mud” to his “childhood as a boy in the midst of my family, always enthusiastic about toys and string, and always a junkman of bits of wire and all the prettiest stuff in the garbage can.”

The allegorical Spring is monumental in subject and scale, standing over seven feet tall. Like a spontaneous line drawing, her form is described by both sweeping outlines and intricate detail—the looped flower in her hand, the undulating strand of hair, or the artist’s clever signature dangling below her waist. In New York, audiences reportedly tugged at her breasts, wood doorstops bought at the five-and-ten-cent store, and while on view at the Salon des Independents in Paris in 1929, viewers pulled her to the side, allowing her to sway back and forth. Calder then rolled Spring into a bale with another wire sculpture and stored the works with a friend until his 1964–65 retrospective at the Guggenheim. According to Calder, when he disentangled the thirty-five year old Spring, she “had all the freshness of youth—of my youth.”",199,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/alexander-calder/spring-1928.jpg,490

He takes the sinuous forms of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/art-nouveau-modern]Art Nouveau[/url] (a decorative style he had used as a commercial artist and in images such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/northern-river-1915][i]Northern River[/i][/url], 1915), and the brash and vivid colors of the early [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism]Expressionists[/url] (especially in the ribbons of red in the foreground, outlining boulder-shaped areas), and uses them to create his composition. The image, based on a landscape he knew well, contains imaginary elements too.

Thomson places the pine tree alone on a point beside a lake. It stands in the middle of the canvas, lopped off at the top—a position that transforms a simple subject into one making a strong and provocative statement. The twisted trunk and branches show age and perseverance, and bravery against the elements. The painting may also reflect Thomson’s state of mind—a mental or metaphorical self-portrait. He may have felt empathy with the tree, for the way it had grown and survived. He painted this canvas while, in Europe, the First World War was raging—a cataclysmic event in which many of his friends were involved. Survival, threatening circumstances, and the possibility of great loss had become paramount issues for everyone around him.
 
The background of the painting is a complicated invention of the animated sky, scudding clouds, and wind-driven whitecaps, which together reinforce the painting’s (posthumous) title. Between sky and lake lie the thin wedge of shore and far hills, at once separating yet fusing air and water with pitch-dark vertical stitches of pigment in Prussian green and blue. What impresses viewers most about this painting is its power and energy. The surging sky and the constant movement on the lake’s surface limit the only stillness in the picture: the pine tree itself. Of the entire Canadian canon, this painting is closest in its intensity to the paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent van Gogh[/url].

The completed canvas is very different, both as an idea and in its detail, from the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/sketch-for-the-west-wind-1916]sketch[/url] Thomson made in the spring of 1916. Whereas most of Thomson’s small oil sketches were markedly fresher, stronger, and more intimate than the canvases derived from them, this painting surpasses the sketch with its dynamism. No other canvases by Thomson, with the exceptions of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-jack-pine-1917][i]The Jack Pine[/i][/url] 1917 (sketched and painted in the same time frame as [i]The West Wind[/i]), and of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/opulent-october-1916][i]Opulent October[/i][/url] 1916 (painted the winter before from a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/sketch-for-opulent-october-1915]sketch[/url] done in the summer of 1915), share this same superb quality.
 
More often, the canvases fail to attain the level of intensity and immediacy that an artist experiences when the moment of inspiration strikes and the subject is at hand. The working-up of several other canvases done at this time, 1916–1917, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/woodland-waterfall-1916][i]Woodland Waterfall[/i][/url] 1916 (not a successful painting), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-fisherman-1917][i]The Fisherman[/i][/url] 1917, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-drive-1917][i]The Drive[/i][/url] 1917, are all examples of paintings with the stagey quality and stiff awkwardness that led Dr. James MacCallum (a friend and patron of Thomson) to claim they were unfinished. They have neither the confidence nor the magisterial aplomb of [i]The West Wind[/i] or [i]The Jack Pine[/i].",680,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/tom-thomson/the-west-wind-1917.jpg,600

As in her painting Autobiography of an Embryo, Agar was exploring the themes of life, death, the passing of time and seasonal cycles. She uses a single, simple image to encompass a range of universal themes. Although it looks abstract, the collage shows a mechanical reaper cutting a crop on a farm, a metaphor for the end of life. She described and explained the collage in 1978:

""The leaf came from a 'dry garden', a book I have which dries and preserves leaves pressed between special paper. It was dead originally when used for the collage, but it was one I must have picked myself. The whole watercolour was intended to suggest a symbolic reaper with the flailing movement of the scythe-like concentric forms. The title indeed relates to time, the seasons and especially death the Great Reaper. The dead leaf being the hub of the whole.

Time is expressed more especially by the large black sun, which at the bottom left hand corner is sinking. The little triangle suggests a country roof and the two black spots two people riding the machine. There is also the outline of the back of a cow, with the small forelegs implanted on either side of the stem of the leaf."" (Conversation of 29 July 1978, quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1976-78, p.27.

The painting is mounted on blue paper and the frame was a 'found' object painted in silver and gold. Although the artist denied that the framing had any 'special significance' she agreed that the mount and frame work with the painting to evoke secondary associations, for example the blue and gold can be linked to the sky and the sun.

The picture was first exhibited in 1965 when Marlborough Fine Art reviewed the avant-garde of the 1930s in the exhibition Art in Britain 1930-1940. (Chloe Johnson)",1536,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/eileen-agar/the-reaper-1938.jpg,1172

The title was given after it was painted, to form a poetic metaphor.' It develops a theme explored in a series of paintings made between 1968 and 1976, following Pasmore's move to Malta. He turned from relief construction to a more symbolic content, expressed in colour, shape and line. In the earlier of these works, as here, rounded, organic looking abstract motifs appeared to be held in space by dark rod-like forms. Pasmore also links 'The Green Earth' to very early abstracts, like 'Square Motif, Blue and Gold: The Eclipse', also in this gallery: 'it was one of the first to return to my interest in colour.'

At one time thought to be The Grove in Highgate, the building has been identified by local historian Roy Allen as being in Belsize, Middlesex (what is now Belsize Park in northwest London). In 1696, when this picture was made, the whole of Belsize belonged to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey (the Abbey and other landmarks are visible on the horizon). The road in the foreground is what is now Rosslyn Hill. The coach is heading towards Hampstead.
The country house and estate portrait, of which Siberechts was the most accomplished practitioner, was a fashionable genre in Britain by the late seventeenth century.

The water level of the lake varies with precipitation in the mountains surrounding the area, revealing the jetty in times of drought and submerging it during times of normal precipitation.

Smithson reportedly chose the Rozel Point site based on the blood-red color of the water and its connection with the primordial sea. The red hue of the water is due to the presence of salt-tolerant bacteria and algae that thrive in the extreme 27 percent salinity of the lake's north arm, which was isolated from fresh water sources by the building of a causeway by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1959.

Smithson was attracted to the Rozel Point site because of the stark anti-pastoral beauty and industrial remnants from nearby Golden Spike National Historic Site, as well as an old pier and a few unused oil rigs. While observing the construction of the piece from a helicopter, Smithson reportedly remarked ""et in Utah ego"" as a counterpoint to the famous pastoral Baroque painting et in Arcadia ego by Nicolas Poussin.

To move the rock into the lake, Smithson hired Bob Phillips of Parson's Construction of nearby Ogden, Utah, who used two dump trucks, a large tractor, and a front end loader to haul the 6,650 tons of rock and earth into the lake. It is reported that Smithson had a difficult time convincing a contractor to accept the unusual proposal. Spiral Jetty was the first of his pieces to require the acquisition of land rights and earthmoving equipment.

He began work on the jetty in April 1970. Construction took six days.

In 1970 during the construction of the jetty, Robert Smithson wrote and directed a 32-minute color film, ""Spiral Jetty"". The film was shot by Smithson and his wife Nancy Holt, and funded by Virgina Dawn and Douglas Christmas.",850,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/robert-smithson/spiral-jetty-1970.jpg,556

Alongside this, Blake retained a strong interest in English popular culture. His work suggests a sense of nostalgia for the paraphernalia of his childhood. Blake collected old toys and related imagery; this piece developed as both a work of art and a store for his collection of objects.",1152,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/peter-blake/the-toy-shop-1962.jpg,930

He uses a selection of photographic images anchored by text. The most famous of which titled ‘wrong’ shows an image with poor composition juxtaposed by the text ‘wrong’ bellow the photograph. This image references a chapter on composition in a photography techniques book. The irony of the word is what makes the image so appealing, just blatant judgement of the photograph. The message that Baldessari was trying to say in the image is why should we conform to conventional aspects of art or photograph, why does our work have to be judged? The interesting fact is that an idea cannot be wrong or right as it is executed as a personal response. John Baldessari once stated: ""You don't want anyone to say 'You can't do that!'

Built up over time, the different layers of colours intersected, overlapped and ate away at one another, creating the soft-edged square shapes now visible. As the artist himself explained: 'I did not draw these shapes in this configuration - the shapes and their relationship grew out of this process of allowing each colour area to adjust physically to adjacent colour areas'.",1156,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/patrick-heron/brown-ground-with-soft-red-and-green-august-1958-july-1959-1959.jpg,814

It depicts a Ancient Roman slave auction. It shows the marketing of seven young people, ranging in age from children to young adults, as slaves. Both male slaves, as well as three of the female slaves, bear a similarity in appearance perhaps suggesting that they are members of a family forced into slavery by economic conditions. All are wearing tags to indicate their availability as slaves. The taller, standing, young woman is wearing a translucent garment which clearly shows her breasts and pubic hair--she is trying to shield her eyes, perhaps because her potential buyers include former friends and neighbors, who are probably seeing her nude for the first time. The auctioneer eats his lunch with a very casual attitude.

From a common type of Salon academic art of the period, it depicts an eroticized scene clad as a history painting, as was customary at the time in Paris. Boulanger had visited Italy, Greece, and North Africa, and the painting reflects his attention to culturally correct details and skill in rendering the female form.",800,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/gustave-boulanger/the-slave-market-1882.jpg,594

In March 1962 Agar wrote about the first time she met him (Chamot, Farr and Butlin, p.6). It had been in either 1938 or 1939, when he had arrived with the writer and poet David Gascoyne (b.1916), halfway through a dinner party Agar was hosting.

""Dylan (then about 25 I believe) sat on the floor and began reciting very lively limericks. Suddenly all the lights went out - a fuse - and when they had come on again the whole mood of our rather dull party had changed. It had come alive with the advent of the two poets. This is when I made a sketch of Dylan, from which, after much meditation and many years had passed, I painted (very quickly) the head now in the Brook Street Gallery"" (Agar quoted in Chamot, Farr and Butlin, pp.6-7).

Agar developed this style of painting from her experiments with automatism, the technique of painting spontaneously in an attempt to tap into the unconscious. Ultimately, she found 'the process of automatic artistic creation' rather unsatisfactory. She explained, 'I am suspicious about the whole idea of working from dreams. I find that daytime dreams can be inspiring, but not night-time ones - they are too confusing. My own method is to put myself in a state of receptivity during the day' (Agar quoted in Simpson, Gascoyne and Lambirth, p.26). She also found the technique associated with automatism, which involved dribbling oil paint and lacquer onto the canvas from a height, left too much to chance effects.

She arrived in Europe in Rotterdam in 1741, becoming the fifth living rhinoceros to be seen in Europe in modern times since Dürer's Rhinoceros in 1515. After tours through towns in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, France, Italy, Bohemia and Denmark, she died in London.

In 1748, she visited France. She was in Reims in December 1748, and was received by King Louis XV in January 1749 at the royal menagerie in Versailles. She spent 5 months in Paris, creating a sensation: letters, poems, and songs were written about her, and wigs were created à la rhinocéros. Clara was examined by the naturalist Buffon, Jean-Baptiste Oudry painted a life-size portrait of her, and she inspired the French Navy to name a vessel Rhinocéros in 1751. A drawing based on Oudry's painting appeared in Diderot and D'Alembert's Encyclopédie, and Buffon's Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière.",1775,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/00284/images/jean-baptiste-oudry/jean-baptiste-oudry-rhinozeros-clara-1749.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Although her acquaintance with the leading figures of European Surrealism manifested itself in the Surrealist strategies apparent in her own work during the 1930s, she did not subscribe to the radical politics of her European counterparts. In 1936 she was invited by Herbert Read and Roland Penrose to exhibit work at the International Surrealist Exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries, London. The notoriety of the exhibition raised Agar's public profile considerably and, in 1937, she was one of the few artists asked to submit work for the Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

In the spring of 1939 Agar and her partner, Joseph Bard, moved to the vicinity of Toulon in the South of France. According to the artist, one day, while watching fishermen haul in their nets at Carquieranne, a small fishing port nearby, she noticed a Greek amphora broken into two pieces caught in one of the nets. This amphora, which she acquired from the fisherman, forms the central element of Marine Object. She had found the crustaceans and flotsam applied to the amphora two years earlier on a beach near Mougins, Côte d'Azur. On the base of the assemblage is a ram's horn that she had picked up in Cumberland. Describing the making of Marine Object as 'short work', Agar added, 'though it took me and the amphora a long time to attempt such a conjunction!' (Agar, p.144).

Agar had collected seemingly unremarkable ephemera found on the seashore and in various publications since childhood, but it was only in the mid 1930s that she began to incorporate these objects into her work. The surrealist practice of transformation of found objects through unexpected juxtapositions was for Agar, like collage, 'a form of inspired correction, a displacement of the banal by the fertile intervention of chance or coincidence' (quoted in Agar, p.147). Discussing the ephemerality of her assemblages and those of other Surrealists, Agar commented that the objects had been found 'at the behest of chance and went that way also' (Agar, p.140). While many of Agar's assemblages were made for a particular event, it is not known if Marine Object was.

Like many of the paintings from the late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty it deals with man's place in nature. Upon a first viewing, however, the craggy peak in this painting seems somewhat distorted. What makes this painting so unique is that it appears to depict the mountain bowing. A monk stands placidly on a boat that floats along the Qin-Huai river, staring up in admiration at the genuflecting stone giant. The economy of respect that circulates between man and nature is explored here in a sophisticated style reminiscent of surrealism or magical realism, and bordering on the absurd. Shi Tao himself had visited the river and the surrounding region in the 1680s, but it is unknown whether the album that contains this painting depicts specific places. Re-presentation itself is the only way the feeling of mutual respect that Shi Tao depicts in this painting could be communicated; the subject of a personified mountain simply defies anything simpler.",469,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/shitao/reminiscences-of-qin-huai.jpg,600

The later 'Veils', of which there are approximately 130, were begun in the winter of 1957-58, soon after his exhibition at the Jackson Gallery in November 1957.* The series was effectively concluded after his show at French and Company, held in April 1959, but occasional 'Veil' paintings were still painted until the winter of 1959-60. The exact dating of Louis' 'Veil' paintings within this sequence is problematic as most were not dated by the artist and remained unstretched and unexhibited for some time after his death.

Louis expressed little interest in the titles of his works at least from 1954 onwards. The paintings were only given titles when it became necessary, for example when a work left the studio for an exhibition.** Most paintings were therefore named posthumously. After Louis' death it was decided to title the 'Veils' with transliterations of names of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The pictures were titled arbitrarily, in order of being stretched. The title Dalet Zayin combines the fourth and seventh letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

Michael Lloyd & Michael Desmond European and American Paintings and Sculptures 1870-1970 in the Australian National Gallery 1992 p.300.

*Diane Upright Headley has dated the beginning of the second 'Veil' series at this date on the basis of a letter from Louis to Greenberg which mentions that a 'Veil' painting had been shown to a potential client in the spring of 1958. As this painting, Untitled 1958 (collection Mrs H. Gates Lloyd, Haverford, Pennsylvania), is a fully developed work it is likely that it was preceded by earlier trials (see Diana Upright Headley, 'In Addition to the Veils', Art in America, vol.66, no.1, January-February 1978, pp.84-94, cf. p.88)
**Even in the case of those works titled for exhibition, most of the titles it seems were suggested by the critic Clement Greenberg (see Diana Upright Headley, 'Morris Loius: The complete Paintings, New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1935, p.37) The generic title for Louis' series 'Veil', was coined by William Rubin (see William Rubin, letter to the editor, Artforum, vol. 9, no. 7, March 1971, p.78).",600,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/morris-louis/dalet-zayin-1959.jpg,453

This vessel is a pleyt – a single-mast, sprit-rigged, shallow draught, broad-hulled tub, very similar to a smalschip – adapted to carry large numbers of passengers slowly in calm inland waters. The two pleyten here are made to look as if successive views of the same vessel and show how the sail is lowered as the boat drifts towards the jetty. A drummer announces the arrival of the service and a man fends off with a bargepole. This is a remarkably large scale image of a boat, but there is nothing remarkable about the boat itself or the function it is performing. There are some burghers aboard the pleyt and the rowing-boat but no obvious dignitary; there are many ships in the background but nothing to suggest that this is a review of the Dutch fleet. What we see here is literally a daily occurrence.

The drama of presentation here does not just depend upon the isolation of the ferry and its scale. The water-skimming viewpoint means that the hull stands out against the horizon, which glows like a halo as the setting sun catches the mist coming off the sea; it also pushes the mast up into the clouds. These clouds are shaped rather like those in Rembrandt’s Three Trees (British Museum) to suggest the forms of angels or zephyrs surrounding the light of the sky. Hoogstraten later advises artists to ‘Observe the lovely gliding of the clouds, and how their drift and shapes are related to one another, because the eye of the artist must always recognise things by their essence while the common folk see only weird shapes.’

‘Peopled clouds’ were familiar from allegorical prints, like that depicting the Dutch ‘ship of state’, produced in 1620 to celebrate the Synod of Dordrecht (1618-9) and showing the Stadholder, Prince Maurice of Orange, at the tiller, surrounded by the Seven Provinces, lit from the sky by a figure of Truth holding the States Bible, while the Pope drowns. This Passage Boat appears too ordinary to be a ‘ship of state’, yet the image carries the same visionary enthusiasm. This is probably intended to be a more private allegory of salvation of the type which a spiritual person reads in the ordinary fabric of the world. It would certainly be unlikely for a contemporary viewer to look at this boat without noticing that the mast and sprit-pole make a cross.

The title, The Thinker, which I gave this humble piece ironically, contrasts with the feeling of Rodin's Thinker, which belongs to a different world. As I progressed with this style, I began to see the rights and wrongs of those who agree and those who disagree. I realized only quite late that it is very difficult to combine the two styles: the style of drawing that takes account of chiaroscuro, and what may be called the oriental approach, which contains within it the quality of the colour scales. This work was painted in reaction to my academic studies and tradition.'

Despite its smallness, the vast expanse of desolate plain and leaden sky give breadth to the scene as does the dilated perspective around the central figure of the Emperor magnified by a slightly low angle.
The least details are minutely recorded: Napoleon's sprouting beard, the veins on the horse's legs, the snow dirtied by the marching troops... the Director of the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Charles Blanc, said that Meissonier ""painted grandly in a small size"". The artist applied the same meticulous approach, but as a historian this time, to his preparatory research: he collected abundant documentation, questioned many eyewitnesses and tried unsuccessfully to borrow the Emperor's grey coat.

Meissonier's approach was part of the historical realism movement which invaded painting and sculpture under the Second Empire. The episode he has chosen, although it occurred after several victories, announces forthcoming defeats. There is no action or event, just an atmosphere of loneliness and despondency. The doubts and resignation felt by the officers and the troops are palpable and are opposed to the determination that emanates from the isolated figure of Napoleon. These feelings are accentuated by the colour range: the whole scene uses brown and grey tones, subdued, deadened registers. The protagonists are not trampling virgin snow, but muddy ground.

Campaign of France, 1814 is in fact the first painting of an unfinished cycle of Napoleon's conquests, which brought Meissonier great acclaim.",900,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/00381/images/ernest-meissonier/meissonier-ernest-1815-1891-napoleon-everett.jpg,586

This painting is however dramatically different from his usual work of this period. Instead it follows in the tradition of the landscapes from his later Flemish period, which he occasionally still produced. By comparing A Horse-Drawn Cart with Two Women Travelling down a Flooded Road at the Edge of a Wood to a painting from his Flemish period, such as Peasants Crossing a Stream, which was executed over twenty years earlier, it becomes apparent that Siberechts has adopted the manner and style of the earlier work in the present painting. Both paintings have a stretch of water in the foreground on which Siberechts has indulged a clear interest in the glittering effects of light off the water’s surface. In both works the dominant figures are female, and the inclusion of cattle wading through the water are a prominent feature. The employment of the expanding distant landscape which leads our eye deep into the background of the work, is again a technique apparent in both paintings.",927,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/jan-siberechts/a-horse-drawn-cart-with-two-women-travelling-down-a-flooded-road-at-the-edge-of-a-wood-1692.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

[i]Dawn[/i] is an example of the imaginary world the artist projects in his paintings: in this case, it is a bleak and barren landscape populated by four figures. The artist presents a surreal scene: four male figures, identical in appearance, are seated turned sideways with their mouths gaping. Even though they are a group, these figures do not relate to each other. Nerdrum repeats this scheme in other paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/wanderers-by-the-sea][i]Wanderers by the Sea[/i][/url] (2001), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/dust-lickers-2005][i]Dust Lickers[/i][/url] (2005) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/limbo][i]Limbo[/i][/url] (2006). In [i]Dawn[/i], the mysterious nature of the painting is enhanced by the strange garments. For instance, the figures upper limbs are restricted by the black cloaks that cover the top halves of their bodies.

The figures in Dawn inhabit a barren environment - the landscape is a kind of wasteland, scarce in resources. Nerdrum based it on landscape studies during his multiple trips to Iceland. While the landscape has a strong sense of realism, it is a mythical space that represents a place beyond reality. This kind of landscape is recurring in Nerdrum’s paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/woman-kills-injured-man][i]Woman Kills Injured Man[/i][/url] (1994), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/the-night-guard][i]The Night Guard[/i][/url] (1986-1988), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/twins-by-the-sea-1999][i]Twins by the Sea[/i][/url] (1999) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/lunatics-2001][i]Lunatics[/i][/url] (2001). The artist created a world which is a far cry from modern life and society. The figures in [i]Dawn[/i] represent human suffering: they are physically restrained and their screams are mute. They live in a world of scarce resources and are left to their own devices: there are no institutions to clothe, feed, school, house or provide for them in old age. It is a surreal scene, a synthesis of fantasy and reality that expresses feelings of isolation and alienation.  

Paintings like [i]Dawn[/i] stood out at a time when contemporary art was dominated by abstract and conceptual art. Nerdrum focused on traditional craftsmanship, drawing inspiration from Old Masters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url]. Later in 1998, Nerdrum articulated his artistic point of view in his manifesto [i]On Kitsch[/i]. Tradition is at the center of Nerdrum’s art: he embraces the craftsmanship of traditional European painting, as well as the dramatic and emotionally charged qualities of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] art. The artist understands [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/kitsch#!#resultType:masonry][i]kitsch[/i][/url] in a positive light, as an artistic device that through narrative and sentiment portrays the human experience. In the contemporary and postmodern context, [i]kitsch[/i] becomes an avant-garde form of expression. 

Dawn was purchased by music legend David Bowie in the autumn of 1990. The painting intrigued the musician so much that it was reported that he especially met with Nerdrum to discuss the symbolism behind it. After Bowie’s death in 2016, the painting was auctioned at Sotheby’s. Surpassing estimates, [i]Dawn[/i] was sold for a record price of ₤341,000. [i]Dawn[/i] also holds a special place in popular culture: the painting was recreated in Tarsem Singh’s science fiction horror film [i]The Cell[/i] (2000).",1792,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/odd-nerdrum/dawn-1990.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

In keeping with the ideas of his fellow abstract expressionists, Okada drew imagery from his subconscious, allowing it to dictate his creative hand. He had no preconceived imagery for a picture, but preferred working in the spirit of Zen Buddhism, which emphasizes meditation. Occasionally he was known to work out the ideas for a composition using natural elements such as sticks, stones, and paper. This process helped him to develop the image before actually beginning his painting.

In Footsteps, the tiny daubs of gray and black paint that lead the viewer's eye into the composition, the broken, black horizontal line in the upper right, and the porous brown triangular shape in the bottom left are evocative of pebbles, rocks, and sticks. Okada's tendency to suggest landscape arises in the faint horizontal shape on the right resembling a mountain or hill, the white amorphous shapes evoking clouds, and the touches of gray in the center resembling footprints in the snow—a fleeting suggestion for the title of this painting. The geometric shapes clustered on the left of the canvas, suggest houses, windows, and roofs, implying human presence in harmony with nature. Okada revealed his Asian heritage through the calm simplicity of the composition, the soft, muted palette, and the subtle allusions to nature. By balancing void against condensed weight, he realized the oriental pictorial tradition of implying vast and ambiguous space.

Okada achieved texture in Footsteps by scraping back paint, painting wet-into-wet, splattering paint onto a dry surface, and using a dry brush. Drips of paint run in different directions on the composition, suggesting that Okada rotated the canvas as he worked. The painting is built up with thin oil washes; bare ground is exposed in some areas between forms, but most of the canvas is covered with thin glazes. The geometric shapes and the interweaving of lush textures and tones suggest aspects of nature.",640,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/kenzo-okada/footsteps-1954.jpg,552

A rustic wicker basket made of thirty-four steamed sticks of bent willow and lashed with split canes make the form of the basket. This is laid on its side and secured to a rectangular piece of corrugated cardboard with obvious blobs of discoloured synthetic glue. A pencilled location line drawn by the artist on the top face of the card is visible below the basket. Within the encircled handle and belly of the basket is a bivalve shell, a light brown coloured gourd with a knobbly surface, conjoined and painted wood draughtsmen’s curbs which protrude between the fifteenth and sixteenth spars of the basket, and a painted and shaped shrimp made of fibreboard. These loose elements are placed in prescribed positions when the sculpture is installed.

There is evidence, in the adhesive residue, that the shrimp was originally stuck to the basket, the passage of time has weakened and detached these bonds. There is a considerable amount of yellowing adhesive on the smooth side of the shrimp’s curved body, whisker and the centre front of the basket. Numerous small areas of paint loss and scuffs are on the tail edge and red body of the shrimp and at several sites on the curbs. The three conjoined curbs, which are bonded together below the paint with obvious blobs of adhesive, might have been used as a negative stencil; they are hand painted crudely with several layers of artist’s oil paint in shades of blue, green and red. One curb had its end broken and missing before being painted. The manufacturers impressed inscription 14 MADE IN ENGLAND is on the red/ brown side of the central curb. The split cane, lashing the basket together, has become loose, probably caused by the historic desiccation of the material. There are some discoloured marks and surface losses on the gourd and shell. The cardboard base has well worn edges with minor separation of the corrugated layers.

There is no artist’s inscription. The sculpture has to be displayed under controlled relative humidity in a closed microclimate to maintain the wooden elements in their present condition. (Sandra Deighton)",892,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/eileen-agar/fish-basket-1965.jpg,986

Maybe he'll have a day off tomorrow."" In fact, on the following day, he came in a great hurry, wearing naval uniform. I drew him twice sitting in a padded armchair and asked him to come again two or three times so that I could make a few small paintings of him wearing his naval uniform.

In Craig Kauffman’s Loops series of 1969, each work comprises a sheet of Plexiglas that the artist molded into a looping fold at its top then sprayed with subtle gradations of acrylic paint. Hanging suspended from a chain a few inches from the wall, the objects seem to hover, and the color on their surface appears also in the shadows the work casts on the wall behind. Though Kauffman’s loops represent his continued exploration of color and of industrial materials, the phenomenological nature of their display brings them close to minimalism as it began to be defined in the second half of the 1960s.",387,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/craig-kauffman/untitled-from-the-loops-series-1969.jpg,580

It is believed to have been painted by the artist Sir David Wilkie in 1815. Billy Waters was one of at least 10,000 people of African origin who lived in London in the early 19th century. Like many former slaves he had fought for the British in the American Revolutionary War. It was during this period that he lost his leg.
Waters was a popular and well-known figure, playing his fiddle and entertaining children outside London’s West End theatres. He was elected ‘King of the Beggars’ just before his death in 1823. He was one of several African personalities featured in the publication Life in London (1821).  In this painting, Waters is portrayed as dignified and proud. Although in public he often acted the clown, this painting suggests a more serious and powerful side to him.",580,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/david-wilkie/billy-waters-mariner-and-street-performer-beggar-1815.jpg,760

Black over Blue, first exhibited in the Betty Parsons Gallery, reflects his recurring interest in both layered works and non-traditionally shaped canvases. His paintings are often hung away from the wall, giving them a three-dimensional, sculptural quality. In fact, the painting's interaction with the wall was a strong focus for Kelly. In Black over Blue, the curved, black panel extends beyond the confines of the rectangular blue canvas, making the surrounding wall an essential part of the composition. Wall, artwork, and space itself become nearly equally important aspects of the viewer's experience, finally leading to a heightened awareness of one's own body as a similar, energized ""gesture"" in the same architectural setting.",418,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/ellsworth-kelly/black-over-blue-1963.jpg,546

The subtle use of texture and treatment of the surface adds a three-dimensional aspect to the painting. The forms are deliberately asymmetrical and hand-drawn, exemplifying the subtle subversion of European geometric abstraction in Brazilian art through the introduction of organic or destabilising elements. Schendel contributed to the development of Concrete and Neo-concrete art in Brazil during the 1960s, though she remained detached from those groups and developed a distinct and unique body of work.",572,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/mira-schendel/untitled-1963(1).jpg,730

Gilliam folded the canvas like an accordion and let the paint dry for a while.

Here, we see Hesse interested in something relatively free of erotic overtones, but just as extraordinary, by marrying Minimalist forms with Expressionist gesture. Indeed, the square pieces of slate with equal spaces of blank wall between them utilize the formal, highly reductive vocabulary of Minimalism. This visually muted impression is overcome, however, by the twisted fibers that approximate the effects of early 1950s ""Action Painting"". The push and pull between these different sources of inspiration and such starkly contrasting textures create a dissonance that gives Metronomic Irregularity a unique intensity, evoking at once the beat of a clock and the disarray of an all-enveloping windstorm.",1024,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/eva-hesse/metronomic-irregularity-ii-1966.jpg,601

It is believed to show a scene at Fisherton Delamere, near Salisbury. Shortly before the painting was exhibited at the British Institution in 1817, he wrote to the great art patron and amateur landscape painter Sir George Beaumont. Wilkie asserted that although landscape painting was entirely new to him, the picture was done with the sole object of teaching himself how to ‘paint an out-door scene with facility’. Wilkie was a great admirer of seventeenth century Dutch landscapes, and this practical scene of work and nature recalls the paintings of Jacob van Ruisdael and Meindert Hobbema, especially in the inclusion of the water-wheel motif.",540,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/david-wilkie/sheepwashing-1817.jpg,355

The piece was inspired, Smith has said, by the medieval book of hours, the volumes of Christian observance that provided ""some kind of meditation, something you could think about or believe in,"" for every hour of the day. Choosing ""fluids everyone knows about that come out of the body,"" Smith found physical substitutes for the intangibles of religious belief. She also created a provocative friction between the scale and uniform shape of the bottles and the intimate and internal processes evoked by the words they bear.

For Smith, the human body, even more than human consciousness, is ""our primary vehicle for experiencing our lives."" A more consistent presence in Smith's art than any format or medium (her materials range from concrete to glass, and she has also produced many prints), the body is a widespread concern in the art of the 1980s and 1990s. This focus is partly aesthetic, reflecting a need to break from immediate precedents—the dematerialized linguistic propositions of Conceptual art, or the hard, machine-made, geometric surfaces of Minimalism. But the period also saw intense public debate on issues of sexuality and health, and on their convergence in the AIDS crisis.

But yellow is more poetic than ochre’. The majority of the image is built up from what appears to be decorator’s gloss paint applied over an eggshell white ground. The ground is visible on the edges of the panel and in some areas of its face. In contrast to the generally high level of gloss, areas of the artist’s later retouching to the left of the ochre lozenge shape and at the centre top have a matt finish; slight yellowing of the main white paint layer has rendered them more apparent. Pencil underdrawing can be seen along the right hand edge of the ochre form, while the broad black lines were painted with the aid of masking tape. Photography under raking light reveals that the ochre form at one time tapered upwards, almost to the top of the main panel, but was subsequently painted over. The plywood panel is mounted within a varnished pine frame, the inner face of which is lined with wood veneer to match that on the back panel. The panel is attached to the frame by screws from the back located into four pine supports arranged around the rear of the painted board. The frame is integral to the work. Yellow Abstract is one of a group of paintings dominated by a single expansive area of strong colour made by Pasmore between 1959 and 1963. The forms in these paintings, though irregular in shape, were very simple at first and became increasingly complex, being developed by the artist into the interwoven biomorphic forms of later works.",752,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/victor-pasmore/yellow-abstract-1961.jpg,752

Created in the artist’s studio in Nishinomiya City, Japan, it was made using a number of sheets of newspaper, topped with a sheet of brown cartridge paper, pasted together with a glue made with flour and water. It was then painted white with hints of pale blue, and its surface was pierced irregularly to reveal the different layers underneath and the painting’s wooden backboard. Viewed from a distance, the overall effect is that of a lunar landscape, all craters and bumps. The contrast between the delicate hues and appealing surface on the one hand, and the violence and destructiveness of Shimamoto’s piercing of the surface on the other, can be said to suggest an interesting relationship between the perceived violence of his work and the qualities of beauty and order prized in traditional Japanese culture.

In a letter of 16 July 2002 to Tate, the artist revealed that he had started to paint on supports made of glued newspaper because in the early 1950s he could not afford to purchase canvas. Shimamoto found that the newspaper support would tear if the glue was not entirely dry before he started to paint on his makeshift support, or if the paper he had used was too delicate, and this provided him with the inspiration for his Holes series. When these works were first exhibited, they were largely ridiculed in Japan but admired by the innovative circles frequented by the artists who would form the Gutai Bijutsu Kyokai (Gutai Art Association) in 1954 under the aegis of the establish painter Jirō Yoshihara (1905-1972).",923,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/shozo-shimamoto/holes-1954.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

He had returned to Bali to get married, and his art from this period is a deep reflection of his roots and the changes being wrought by modernization and economic growth on his homeland. Masriadi has said that a painting should speak for itself without any explanation from the artist. His works from this period contain spontaneous sketches and drawings that emerge on the surface of his paintings, and together strongly speak for the Artist. 'Save the Land' is a comment on the uncontrolled development of Bali and the universal theme of environmental awareness. This theme is deeply personal for Masriadi, as when he was a child his parents opened a roadway stall on what was a quiet road but which soon became a noisy and congested nightmare. His horror at the noise and loss of the peace and calm of the rice fields, seems to have driven Mariadi, into an inner world of isolation, contemplation and observation.",1202,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/nyoman-masriadi/save-the-land-1998.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Blake’s fascination with American popular culture is further emphasised by his baseball boots and badges, and the magazine dedicated to Elvis Presley, who had just become well known in Britain. Blake uses these objects like a traditional portrait painter, to suggest his interests or achievements.

By then he felt that this format had become an inhibiting factor which he had to destroy or pass beyond. He began to experiment with works of an environmental character and to create a space which people could walk around and into, and at the same time see through.

The Oyster Eater, the high point of his work at that time, brings together these different pictorial genres magnificently. The picture shows his sister Mitche concentrating on eating oysters, with a profusion of flowers, plates and table linen before her. But The Oyster Eater was certainly too bold for the highly conservative milieu at the time, and was rejected at the 1882 Salon in Antwerp.

However, Ensor was not entirely without success in traditional circles as he exhibited a painting at the Brussels Salon in 1881 and two others in Paris in 1882. He then committed himself to the liberalisation of art exhibitions, and fought to become the leader of an artistic school. He was particularly involved in creating the group known as Les XX who quickly came to play a leading role in the avant-garde. 

Brought up on the shores of the North Sea, Ensor was passionate about the effects of light. In (...) The Oyster Eater, the shimmering liquids in the glasses and the reflections in the mirror already reveal the painter's interest in the power and quality of light. For him it is the opposite of line, which is in itself the ""enemy of genius"" and ""cannot express passion, anxiety, struggle, pain, enthusiasm or poetry, such beautiful and great feelings…"" (from Musée d'Orsay exhibition text)",856,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/james-ensor/the-oyster-eater-1882(1).jpg!HD.jpg,1200

My entire leg was encased in plaster for nine months - for four of which I afterwards discovered the surgeon had contemplated amputation at the knee. As a result I was unable to paint a single canvas for nearly a year - as distinct from works on paper, which could be done in a sitting position. When I finally started painting canvases again I for some reason decided very greatly to enlarge their scale, setting to work on a series of paintings measuring nine, eleven, thirteen and even fifteen feet in length. This painting was one of that series, all of which were exhibited in January 1970 at Waddington's original gallery at number 2, Cork Street, where they were slightly cramped for space, of course.

Unlike Rothko, who, in 1960, showed me the flat in Manhattan where he'd been living and painting until well after he'd enlarged the scale of his canvases to the familiar size of his mature style, with the result that his paintings were touching each other all around the walls of his living-room-cum-studio, as he explained to me - I, myself, have always needed very considerable space for showing my paintings. I've always felt that my canvases simply cannot be seen if they are not more or less isolated by expanses of white wall all around them. Rothko, in total contrast, actually prescribed very close hanging - about 18 ins. between each work. I therefore most enjoyed seeing this painting of mine at the Royal Academy's 1977 exhibition British Painting 1952–1977, where it was isolated on a specially built screen in the centre of one of the galleries, from where it was visible from down a vista of several rooms. The result was that it floated.

About the painting itself, it so happens that I mentioned it in the Power Lecture, entitled ‘The Shape of Colour’, which I gave in Australia in 1973. The following is part of what I said there: ""For instance, in 1969, I arrived at a series of very large paintings ... ‘Cadmium with Violet, Scarlet, Emerald, Lemon and Venetian: 1969’ is an example. Looking back, the object here seems to have been to see how far a few of the familiar elements could be stretched out sideways, with this long horizontal composition (and there's a word, ‘composition’, we needn't run away from), without that largest area of cadmium-red disintegrating back into that vacuous background of neutral nothingness I so much despise! I used to say, as far back as 1959, that what one was looking for, in stretching out a single colour-plane across four-fifths of a canvas, was a full emptiness or an empty fullness. In these very long, very large paintings of 1969 and after, I think one has added to that earlier requirement of ‘full emptiness’ this new one: to see how big a colour-area can become physically while still retaining a visible compactness in its image, a tightness in its design and organisation that remains totally readable, despite the expanded scale of that design, of those images. How far could one expand one's colour-areas without appearing to be distending any or all of them? I have painted a version of this ‘Cadmium with Violet’, with the same colours but on a format only nine inches long. One of the mysteries of scale which seeing the two versions together would demonstrate is to do with what I call the physicality of mere size: the plain physical impact of a large painting, the sheerly quantitative bombardment by the vibrations of really big areas of colour - these constitute a totally new factor. It was simply a fact that, in painting large, one was entering a field of physical sensation which just was not given off by smaller paintings.

It used to be felt that two adjacent areas of flat but differing colours - say a red or a blue - would always take up a fixed spatial position in relation to one another along the line dividing them. It used to be said that the red would always appear to come in front of the blue. My own experience suggests that this is quite untrue. When your eye alights on the sharp linear frontier separating two colour-areas, your sensation that one of those colours is ‘nearer’ to you than the other - this sensation, this conviction that space-in-depth separates the two colour-areas, is overwhelmingly definite as a sensation. Its cause, however, is enormously difficult to pinpoint. In these large recent paintings such as ‘Cadmium with Violet’ one is extremely conscious, as one's eye moves along the frontiers of the various areas, that these areas actually alternate with one another (as one's eye moves) in seeming to be behind or in front of one another - according to whatever loop or angle in the frontier one happens to be focusing upon. For instance, the cadmium-red ground (if you'll excuse the term) does not appear to be uniformly either behind or in front of the more orange ‘harbour-shape’ which extends downwards from the top right-hand corner of the painting. On the contrary, as your eye slides round those outlines the cadmium and the orange [scarlet] appear to keep exchanging their spatial positions. In ‘Colour in My Painting: 1969’ I said ‘Complexity of the spatial illusion generated along the frontier where the two colours meet is ... enormously increased if the linear character of those frontiers is irregular, freely drawn, intuitively arrived at.’ It is the totally regular, the perfectly geometric lines between colours in the movement known as Op Art which distinguishes it entirely from my own-despite our shared interest in optical after-images, and so on. The after-image is for me merely a welcome by-product, not a calculated end-product.""

The period of my work to which this painting belongs came to an end with the paintings I made for my retrospective at the University of Texas at Austin Art Museum during 1977, the year before that exhibition was held (1978). I called them ‘wobbly hard-edge’ when I showed in Australia. Since 1980 the interests pursued in my painting have moved away from the rather exclusive preoccupations described in the long passage from ‘The Shape of Colour’ which I've quoted above.""",1048,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/patrick-heron/cadmium-with-violet-scarlet-emerald-lemon-and-venetian-1969.jpg,520

He once wrote that ""the machine has become more than a mere adjunct of life. It is really a part of human life...perhaps the very soul...I have enlisted the machinery of the modern world, and introduced it into my studio."" His goal, he said, was to invent a ""mechanical symbolism,"" and this piece is one of his most important examples, since critics have read it as an image of a sexual act rendered in mechanical terms. Although, at first glance, it might be hard to read in these terms, Picabia may well have been inspired by his friend Marcel Duchamp to bury sexual references in images of machines. This work is also significant in that it is Picabia's first known collage (hence, as the title suggests, ""very rare"") since it contains two mounted wooden forms, and the frame is integral to the piece. - See more at: http://www.theartstory.org/artist-picabia-francis.htm#sthash.xchIYynP.dpuf",895,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/francis-picabia/not_detected_236816.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

It is thought to have been made at Bath Academy of Art at Corsham Court, Somerset, under the supervision of Henry Cliffe the principal lecturer in lithography. Heron had previously made monotypes and designed scarves for Cresta Silks, but this may have been his first editioned print. It was produced in at least one other colour, yellow having been substituted for the red.

In 1956 Heron began to make what appeared to be non-representational paintings, in defiance of his earlier advocacy of representation. In the same year, he settled in his new home, Eagles Nest, Zennor, above the coast of west Cornwall. The two events converged as the paintings of that year were, despite their abstract appearance, associated with the garden there. In January 1956 the artist made the first of a series of works associated with Eagles Nest's garden - Vertical: January 1956. These are made up of layers of dabs or short strokes of paint, often thin enough for the medium to dribble down the canvas. The deployment of the marks ranges from a relatively rigid structure of vertical strokes to a looser, less evenly dispersed series of short stabs of paint, as in Azalea Garden: May 1956. In some, calligraphic lines of oil paint are drawn across the surface. The present lithograph is closely comparable to this series of paintings in the use of successive layers of short strokes of different colours.",856,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/patrick-heron/red-garden-1956.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

It is an establishment without any particular distinction or charm, but conveniently close to my London studio. The suggestion of colour and object in the title was appealing in that they are absent from the painting, which, however, still retains a visual association with the place itself.

She associated each participant's gesture with one of 52 hand gestures known as Mudrās. In doing so, Rapoport suggested the cross-cultural correlations of hand gestures and their trans-cultural meanings. Mudrās and their word meanings were juxtaposed within a western context and transcribed onto a computer printout and also, into a Kathakali dance. Rapoport discovered that the words people chose to describe their gestures in western culture, and the words given to the gestures in the Mudrā vocabulary were surprisingly similar. Finally, Rapoport created a slide presentation showing current political leaders making similar gestures having similar verbal contexts.

In 1988 she received a grant from the California Arts Council for the production of ""Digital Mudrā"" online via Carl Loeffler and Fred Truck's Art Com Electronic Network (ACEN). In 1989, a simplified version of ""Digital Mudrā"" was uploaded to the Internet as a web-based interactive artwork.

Though reminiscent of minimal forms, these works initiate a dynamic interaction with the public. “Untitled” (1991), however, structures this interaction in a more subtle, reflective way. The work is a unique stack of 161 signed and numbered silkscreens that remain together. Originally presented in the form of a 1989 billboard commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Stonewall Rebellion, its iteration as a stack of prints was meant, as the artist noted at the time, as a “more private and personal object”—one that is not disseminated physically but instead through the experience of remembering. The stark black page and white typeface on each sheet trace a nonlinear chronology of significant events in the history of the gay-rights movement. From the election of Harvey Milk as Supervisor for San Francisco to one of the largest civil rights marches on Washington, D.C., “Untitled” creates an open narrative of dates, names, and places that evoke the collective memory of an ongoing struggle.

He usually added his titles after the compositions had emerged through intuitive decisions. Although the titles do not identify subject matter, they nevertheless guide interpretation. Thus, the title of the present work may encourage one to experience the mood of an interior space illuminated by diffused twilight. An atmosphere of nostalgic reverie is evoked by scumbled, weathered layers of gouache in which pastel colors predominate. Unlike Baziotes's most characteristic works, in which biomorphic shapes float freely on an indefinite background, The Room (1945) is constructed architectonically. The gridded structure derives from Piet Mondrian and the Cubists, models for Baziotes before his encounter with the Surrealists.

He has allowed the paint to drip down and soak into the canvas, emphasising the flat surface of the work. But at the same time, the strong vertical shapes appear to float in front of the deeper space of the red background.",1224,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/john-hoyland/28-5-66-1966.jpg,648

When the lines are thicker they can more properly be read as bars. The lines are one colour against a contrasting coloured ground; or in two or more colours, light and dark, opposition to the ground. The purpose of these lines is to animate the ground, obviously enough, as well as to divide it into calculated areas - straining towards shapes.""

Until the mid-seventies, Hoyland generally restricted the titles of his works to the date on which each was completed. The Whitechapel catalogue listed seven paintings from 1961, five having been completed in the spring of that year: 2. ‘20.3.61’, purple and blue, oil on canvas, 76 × 66""; 3. ‘EASTER 1961’, blue, with violet, oil on canvas 68 × 68""; 4. ‘April 1961’, Lilac, with green, oil on canvas 68 × 68""; 5. ‘25th MAY 1961’, dark plum and black, oil on canvas 60 × 60""; 6. ‘25.5.61’, plum, black and amber, oil on canvas 68 × 60"". Three of these, including No.4, a work very similar in composition to 'April 1961' but larger and identically titled are illustrated in the catalogue and the artist has confirmed that he made a number of closely related works at about this time, which makes identification by catalogue more difficult.

John Hoyland said in 1986 that ‘April 1961’ was painted at a time when he, like many artists of his generation, was trying to come to terms with the impact of American painting - he mentioned that he was particularly impressed by the paintings of Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. At the time he was teaching a basic design course at Hornsey and was involved with problems of visual perception but was also trying to follow the lead of such painters as Rothko and solve the problem of eliminating traditionally rendered form in his paintings. At this stage he already knew artists pursuing similar lines of investigation (Stroud, Turnbull and Denny had also been involved in the ‘Situation’ exhibition), but he had not, for example, seen a painting by Vasarely.

He remembers that he was concerned to try to make paintings which worked all over the surface but which still retained the possibility of space and illusion. Working with lines he could suggest depth and volume with very simple means or elements. He stressed that the climate within which 'April 1961' and related works were made was one where problems of perception, within the framework of the current art school teaching, were constantly being debated (Newman was also particularly influential in this respect). By 1961, Hoyland was beginning to feel that he was not temperamentally suited to the rigid framework that his work was operating within but still felt the need to react (like many of his contemporaries) against the more painterly excesses of the followers of, for example, de Kooning. However, after this point his work became more direct and full-bodied in its execution and imagery.",1186,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/john-hoyland/april-1961-1961.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

But in fact, Gilliam's images are always envisioned as paintings, albeit paintings that like topological descriptions could be enfolded, draped, or given virtual cavities and real cavities, depending on his pictorial intention. Like the early Russian master Vladimir Tatlin, Gilliam was keenly aware of the spatial advantages of the triangular form implicit in corners, or, as the title of this work suggests, angles. In Mars at Angles, he takes full advantage of the shadowy space secreted behind his painting. The gorgeous panoply of color cascading from a single point in the ceiling, and attached at the two angles of the walls, suggests a hidden axis in the very depths of the corner. The flow of Gilliam's drapes, so suggestive of a Renaissance baldacchino, a canopy of richly woven fabric, seems free of the composer's intention, but in fact, is carefully controlled to offer structural coherence. There are hidden geometric axes and diagonals here that are quite as explicitly structural as a painting by one of the great Renaissance masters of drapery, such as the Venetian, Paolo Veronese. Despite its three-dimensional aspect, this work is fundamentally a painting, in which earlier conventions are revitalized in a free experimental spirit.",318,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/sam-gilliam/mars-at-angles-1978.jpg,370

Such early paintings as April 1961, made using the traditional materials of oil on canvas, consist of fine coloured lines against a monotone ground and deal with optical issues. In 1963 Hoyland abandoned oil for acrylic and began painting on cotton duck as well as canvas. He had been deeply influenced by the American Abstract Expressionists. At first he identified more closely with the non-gestural artists in this school, Rothko, Newman and Ad Reinhardt, all of whom insisted on grand scale and the elimination of figurative references. He shared with Newman an interest in colour for its emotive force, but was experimenting to find a different framework within which to do this. As he later commented: ‘what my work has always been about from day one ... formal problems, but only as a vehicle for emotions’ (quoted in Moorhouse, p.14). He was also impressed by an exhibition of the abstract ‘pop’ sculptures of Anthony Caro (born 1924) at the Whitechapel Gallery, London in 1963 and shared with the sculptor the desire to create a new abstract language in his medium. The formal problems he concentrated on stem from the same issues traditional to figurative painting – composition, drawing, space, colour and technique. Colour and space were to take precedence in Hoyland’s work; he rejected the modernist insistence on the flat reality of the picture plane and used colour to create a sense of virtual illusory space. He has explained: ""Colour is used instinctively, not intellectually. But once an instinctive choice is made, the colour tends to be played through as a long sequence. Where to put colour is the crucial question and decision, and always the problem ... if you have a rectangle it is interesting to add to it, to enrich and complicate the area by giving an independent life to shapes inside it and not allow them to be endlessly restricted by their unification with the over-all picture plane.""    (Quoted in John Hoyland: Paintings 1960-67, p.14.)

17.3.69, like the majority of Hoyland’s works of the 1960s, is a large horizontal painting. He always paints the canvas on the wall (rather than the floor), occasionally rotating it to allow the paint to flow vertically towards the top. From 1964 until the end of the decade, red and green predominated as the background colour. 17.3.69 is dominated by two large blocks of monotone red. They are set into narrow margins of uneven green, yellow and brown. The brown forms a wider band along the top of the painting, extending approximately a quarter of the way down. During the mid 1960s Hoyland developed a method of applying thin washes of paint to the canvas which resulted in some areas appearing watery and translucent. These are typically combined with rectangles, squares or strips of colour applied as a creamy, smooth skin of paint resting on top of the thinner paint. The two blocks of red in 17.3.69 are areas of dense paint, sitting on top of the more watery background colours. They reach the same height as each other but the block on the left extends slightly lower, or closer to the bottom edge of the painting, than the block on the right which is wider. This inequality and the balancing of green along the left side and the bottom right create a strong visual dynamic which draws the eye around the painting. The work’s large scale enhances the sense of enveloping space, created by the watery areas of brown filled with the quasi-sculptural blocks of red colour.

The painting’s title, 17.3.69, refers to the date on which it was completed. The use of a date as title has diaristic resonances, suggesting an element of personal expression at odds with the numerical code and the controlled, abstract composition. 25.4.69 (Tate T01129) is a large vertical painting made, as its title indicates, the following month.

They are an equivalent to nature, not an illustration of it'. Since executing his first abstract works in 1958, Hoyland's paintings have proclaimed their self-sufficiency as visual facts or events. In the 1960s Hoyland was mainly involved with formal issues of scale, colour and the relation of shapes. In the 1970s he began to invest these elements with a greater emotive significance. Consequently, as 'North Sound' demonstrates, his handling of the forms in his paintings became looser and more expressive. He explained: 'The structure of form is meant to be a container for colour, a container of feeling'.",882,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/john-hoyland/north-sound-1979.jpg,824

Like Blake, both these artists incorporated images taken from popular culture into a fine art context, and Blake has acknowledged their example. This work refers to Johns's work in particular. Whereas Johns had taken a familiar object - a target - and executed this motif on the canvas in a painterly style, Blake took this further by using a real archery target purchased from a sports shop. The work of art is consequently less like a painting and is even closer to the real world.

These elements evoke the wildness associated with the Scots by many 19th-century English viewers.

As was the practice, Canaletto had to present the Academy with a work, but surprisingly the greatest vedutista of his day preferred a capriccio to a real view of Venice. He started the work after his appointment but didn't complete it until two years later.

Painted on a preparation of red ochre oil, the chromatic values of which have certainly since changed, ""Perspective with a portico"" recalls the courtyard and portico of the Ca’ d’Oro, - the house of gold. The architectural elements that characterise the famous Venetian palazzo are transformed by the artist and inserted into an imaginary setting.
As a bequest, this capriccio met with huge success, proved by the large number of existing replicas, some of which are signed by the hand of the master. It was exhibited on Saint Mark's Square during the Feast of Ascension ""to honour its author"" and was admired by numerous fellow artists, including Guardi.

The driver was grim, sullen, and arrogant, and Segal caught himself thinking, ""My God, dare I trust my life to this prig?"" Soon afterward he found a derelict bus in a junkyard and hacked out the driver's platform. Incorporated in The Bus Driver, this metal armature pens in a plaster figure-a life cast. (The model was Segal's brother-in-law.)

When they first appeared, in the early 1960s, Segal's plaster molds of people in fragments of real environments were considered Pop art, since they described the everyday life of public places. But where Pop often focused on mass-media images and mass-produced objects, Segal was interested in individuals, their gestures, statures, stances, and also their inner, psychological or spiritual condition. He often left his plaster molds unpainted, valuing their whiteness for ""its special connotations of disembodied spirit, inseparable from the fleshy corporeal details of the figure."" In the bus driver (who has been likened to Charon, the ferryman of Greek myth who guides dead souls to the underworld), Segal saw ""the dignity of helplessness—a massive, strong man, surrounded by machinery, and yet basically a very unheroic man trapped by forces larger than himself that he couldn't control and least of all understand.""",312,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/george-segal/the-bus-driver-1962.jpg,420

The installation was first exhibited at Tibor de Nagy Gallery in 1979. Kozloff said the entire piece was her “personal anthology of the decorative arts” because it includes motifs from so many traditions, such as American Indian pottery, Chinese painted porcelains, French lace patterns, Sumerian carvings, Celtic illuminations, Turkish woven and brocaded silks and Coptic textiles. Rather than using assistants Kozloff prefers to hand paint all her tiles, a highly labor intensive process but one which demonstrates her respect for traditional cultures and methods. Rejecting the romantic concept of the artist as an inspired genius working in solitude, she also readily discloses her sources and techniques. Art critic Carrie Rickey wrote in the catalog of the exhibition, “An Interior Decorated is where painting meets architecture, where art meets craft, where personal commitment meets public art.” The project was redesigned for every space in which it was exhibited between 1979 and 1981.",700,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/joyce-kozloff/an-interior-decorated-1979.jpg,416

She is known predominantly for her sculpture and photography, but drawing has been a major part of her practice for the past twenty years. The artist’s engagement with the medium of drawing is such that she has said, ‘If you were to ask me what I do, I would say that I draw. That is the primary activity and all my work has it in common, regardless of idiom or material’ (Roni Horn, quoted in Paulo Herkenhoff, ‘What Is Drawing for Roni Horn?’ in Roni Horn: Drawings, exhibition catalogue, Galerie d’Art Graphique, Centre Pompidou, Paris, 2003, p.27).

Were 12 is one of a series of drawings in which pure pigment is applied directly to paper. In a meticulous process that can take several months Horn begins by fixing rich red pigment to paper with successive brushings of varnish, creating a dense, rough surface. She then cuts the pigmented paper into strips or small geometric shapes. These segments are joined edge to edge with plain paper to create complex and delicate assemblages. The sculptural construction of the drawings is precise; the pieces of paper do not overlap but are carefully juxtaposed. The exact arrangement of the pieces of plain and pigmented paper demonstrates Horn’s sculptural approach to assemblage and her ongoing formal investigation of placement.

Horn began making drawings in this way in the mid-1980s. Over time they have become larger and more formally complex. In Were 12 the sophisticated composition of curvilinear and geometric shapes suggests the outline of flowers. The two distinct forms in the drawing exist in a complementary dialogue and recall the motif of doubling in Horn’s sculptural installations. Jonas Storsve has described the sensual effect of repeated forms in Horn’s drawings. He has written, ‘The connection between two forms, that is one of the leading strands of [Horn’s] work, can be taken as a simple transcription of sensuality which is also present in the very tactile handling of the materials’ (Storsve, ‘Introduction’, Roni Horn: Drawings, p.14).

The work’s title suggests Horn’s interest in language and semantics. Dieter Schwarz has argued that the titles of Horn’s drawings suggest interrelation, saying: ‘[T]he titles ... have in common that they cannot stand independently, but require syntactic completion ... These titles emphasise the incompleteness of each individual element of a drawing, which does not exist independently, but refers to one alongside’ (Schwarz, ‘Just Doubles This The Distant Doubles Must As &amp; others’, in Roni Horn: Rare Spellings, exhibition catalogue, Kunstmuseum Winterthur, 1993, p.116). Other pigment drawings by the artist bear titles including Just, Could, So and Too. Like Were, these are simple words whose brevity belies the range of their possible meanings.",1272,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/roni-horn/were-12-2004.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

They informed the recipients that during the exhibition, the gallery would be closed. “It’s the purest form of this notion of what the physicality of art is and what art is really all about. One doesn’t need to even have the gallery space"", said David Platzker, who sent out numerous announcement cards worldwide, each saying simply “During the exhibition the gallery will be closed”. “I got permission from Robert [Barry] to do the show,” Platzker said. “I asked him if he would lend me copies of the three prior announcement cards and he said, ‘Why would you want them? There is no show. I don’t want people to come to the gallery because the gallery is closed.’",600,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/robert-barry/closed-gallery-1969.jpg,404

For Knoebel, this moment proved significant. Personal loss was experienced in the form of artistic legacy: a bequest from a peer renowned for his gifts as a colorist. Yet, up to that moment, Knoebel had, in contrast to his friend, strictly confined his palette to white and black monochrome fields or, more often, as seen in Raum 19 (Room 19), 1968, depended on the warm natural hues of Masonite. Indeed, Knoebel's fascination with Masonite board had meant that for the first decade of his career, he was more often considered a sculptor than a painter proper. Raum 19 was, like all his works at that time, conceived in materialist terms. The fundamentals of both sculpture and painting comprise its formal language: planar surfaces, supports and stretchers to be stored or stacked, volumetric solids and plastic geometric elements. Tellingly, those features more commonly associated with the pictorial aspects of painting-illusionistic space and the disposition of colored shapes across a flat field-are absent.

When adopting color for the first time in 1977, Knoebel steadfastly held to his materialist aesthetic. Each component in this epic series is a monochrome polygon. Eschewing familiar geometric shapes, such as rectangles, squares, rhomboids, or trapezoids, Knoebel has conceived each complex form as a unique entity that defies easy identification. Similarly, while each hue is indubitably specific, the collective effect exceeds what can be readily remembered; the result is that in this series color is not used conventionally. Less an expressive or referential device, it assumes an abstract character, which in its polyphony comes to signify color tout court. In these and related ways, Knoebel at once extended his ongoing elliptical investigation into the identity of painting and, for the first time, embraced what is traditionally considered its quintessential feature-color-at its most vital and intense.

While this monumental cycle was generated in part in homage to a deceased friend, it nonetheless proved seminal for the artist: it has become the fountainhead in an ongoing investigation that today spans more than thirty years into the multifarious and complex roles color may assume in a contemporary practice.

It is the largest surviving landscape by Cuyp, and arguably the most beautiful. The entire scene is bathed in a gentle sunlight, harmonising all the elements, natural, animal and human. The quality of the light is Italianate. However, Cuyp never travelled to Italy, and he must have acquired this interest from Dutch contemporaries who did, such as Jan Both.

This design is focused more directly on the landscape than in earlier paintings by Cuyp on the same scale, and the figures and animals are more minutely painted. The low sunlit mountains which dominate the peaceful scene are not a feature of the Dutch landscape, but based on mountains seen by Cuyp on his travels in the early 1650s.

According to the painter Benjamin West, it was this picture, acquired by the Earl of Bute in the early 1760s, that began the rage for Cuyp among British collectors in the 18th and 19th centuries. His popularity came to rival that of Claude. Many of his best paintings were imported into Britain and still remain here.",1011,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/aelbert-cuyp/river-landscape-with-horseman-and-peasants-1660.jpg,520

Observing the shifting hues of the sky from inside a pristine, rectilinear space, viewers experience a connection to their surroundings. But more than that, the artist, by confronting us with the empty space, turns our mind to our own mode of seeing.

For his Jerusalem Skyspace, Turrell chose a semicircular terrace along the western slope of the Art Garden. The site was cut in two and dug out, so that the terrace now enfolds a shrine-like inner space evoking places of worship such as pyramids, mausoleums, or temples. A square opening cut into its ceiling makes a frame for an ever-changing abstract ""picture” of the sky, recalling by contrast Baroque illusionist ceilings crowded with painted clouds, saints, and angels.

Space That Sees invites a kind of meditative experience. Twilight conditions yield a particularly startling effect, with the flat surface of the sky turning almost imperceptibly from deep blue to velvet black while the room itself seems to grow increasingly brighter, so that the physical conjunction at the roof opening of interior and exterior becomes a catalyst in the light’s passage from day to night. Turrell saw the installation as an “allegory of light that we generate from inside and light that comes from outside: the emergence into space where light comes forth as in a dream.”

The 12-foot tall, slightly curving Creueta del Coll reflects both of these important new directions in his work.Kelly created a highly abstracted version of a specific, recognizable form - in this case, an ancient Greek statuary form known as kouros, or male youth. Like many of Kelly's sculptures, this one and a half inch-thick piece painted matte-black is very flat and has a two-dimensional quality. He encouraged his viewers to question traditional perspectives by creating sculptural paintings that might sit on the floor and flat sculptures that lean against a wall.",368,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/ellsworth-kelly/creueta-del-coll-1987.jpg,546

In 1960 she set out as an independent artist, producing a series of what have since come to be referred to as ""spectre pictures,"" according to curator E. Luanne McKinnon. What unites these expressionistic abstractions is their flirtation with imagery of the human body and self-portraiture, while they nonetheless seek to express something comparatively intangible, a recurring psychological motif such as a state of mind, a mood or a memory. 
In this piece, Hesse hints at the common format of a studio-based self-portrait by the painter standing at her easel, although one would not see this at the outset, which is precisely Hesse's intention. As in many of the works from this series, Untitled presents a largely monochromatic palette of green pigment accentuated, or visually compartmentalized, by sharply contrasting tonalities articulating the two-dimensional space of the canvas. The compartmental imagery of Untitled will be repeated in Hesse's sculpture, such as in the Repetition Nineteen pieces, and may have been influenced by Hesse's exposure to the work of Louise Nevelson in MoMA's contemporaneous Sixteen Americans show. The gestural brushwork here derives from Hesse's training in the Abstract Expressionist style, while her restricted color scheme and compartmental leanings might be attributed to her study under Albers. All speaks to her desire to simplify, reduce and visually pare the subject down to its most essential qualities.",904,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/eva-hesse/untitled.jpg,900

The painting depicts the logo of the Hollywood studio 20th century Fox complete with spotlights, as it appears at the beginning of every film made by the studio. The painting’s long horizontal format (170x335cm) is even similar to a movie screen.

The idea for the painting came about during Ruscha’s trip to New York in 1961. While staying at the Hotel Governor Clinton, he created [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/trademarck-sketch-1961][i]Trademark Sketch[/i][/url] (1961), a sketch of the studio logo in ball pen drawn on hotel stationery. The sketch had a graphic quality that reflected the artist’s training and experience of working as a commercial artist for advertising companies. His time in New York in 1961 was also significant for a different reason: while there, he also saw early examples of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein#!#resultType:masonry]Roy Lichtenstein[/url] at the [i]Leo Castelli Gallery[/i]. A year later, works like [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] marked the emergence of a West Coast school of pop art comprised of Los Angeles artists. The painting [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] is emblematic of Los Angeles: it evokes the images of the Los Angeles ‘strip’, and represents its significance as the home of the entertainment industry and the center of cinematic culture.

Both in style and choice of subject, Ruscha drew inspiration from advertising imagery. In its format, scale, stylized lines and the flattened planes of color, [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] is reminiscent of an advertising billboard. Ruscha’s literal and exaggerated translation of the 20th century Fox trademark gives the image a comical and ironic quality that is characteristic of Pop Art. In the painting, the artist also explored the relationship between the canvas, the body and the visual environment of Los Angeles. At the core of the composition is the contrast between the large stylized text and the small details. When standing in front of [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i], the composition draws the viewer’s eye to follow the perspectival lines of the text that recede to the tiny point in the lower right corner. The painting was first exhibited in May 1963 at the [i]Ferus Gallery[/i], an important staple of the Los Angeles contemporary art scene in the late 1950s and 1960s. In a gallery setting, the monumental canvas forces the viewer to step back, and walk back and forth to fully appreciate the painting.

This was a chief concern for Ruscha, in multiple paintings from the period he applied different strategies in order to examine different ways in which the viewer can engage with the painting. In [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/actual-size-1962][i]Actual Size[/i][/url] (1962) for instance, Ruscha played with scale, creating a contrast between the large and the small text. Like [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i], [i]Actual Size[/i] engages the viewer by tempting them to examine the painting from up close as well as from afar. Today, [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] is part of the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.",600,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00221/images/edward-ruscha/1.jpg,300

This 20-volume work is a typewritten record of one million years – Past and Future. Biblical in scale, each volume contains 2,068 pages. Past is dedicated to “all those who have lived and died” and Future is “for the last one”. The first reading of One Million Years took place in 1993 at Dia Center for the Arts in New York. Since then live readings have been performed across the world, with a man and a woman alternating the reading of Past and Future dates together, while placed in a special booth. Each new reading continues in numerical order from the previous session, until all the years are read.

One Million Years enables us to grasp time itself in the physical act of reading the dates aloud. It powerfully condenses our entire human history to only a few pages, and an average human life to a few lines.",600,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/on-kawara/one-million-years-1969.jpg,399

Yet despite their apparent simplicity and emphemerality, these acts can evoke far more complex social and political undertones. Conjuring the vocabulary of Minimalism and post-Minimalism while reinvigorating it with open-ended content, Gonzalez-Torres leaves the construction of meaning to the participation of viewers, only subtly hinting at the autobiographical and incendiary in his untitled works. Conceived shortly before the artist’s death, “Untitled” (Golden) (1995) extends across a space as a luminous curtain, shimmering with faceted tendrils of faux-gilded beads. The gentle confrontation of this golden screen provokes the tactile and sensory, inviting the viewer to transform its shape simply by walking through. This collective and public experience of doing so, however, belies the intimate nature of Gonzalez-Torres’s other beaded curtain works, which often reference the organic and inorganic substances associated with battling AIDS.

Baer studied biology and perceptual psychology before doing an art course in Los Angeles from 1953-60. Baer defended the importance of pictures in the context of Minimal Art, though the Minimal artists campaigned vehemently against painting as a relevant art form. By asserting that a painting is an object, and developing an anti-illusionistic style, Jo Baer gave her pictures a powerful physical presence. H. Arcuata (the botanical name for a kind of orchid) is one of a group of pictures dating from around 1970 that were intended to be hung low and viewed from a number of angles. The works become accessible only when the individual areas and the way they develop over the sides of the picture are investigated. Jo Baer felt her pictures contributed to the discussion on ""the sovereignty of the subject and associated questions about the nature of self-determination""(J.B.).",700,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/jo-baer/h-arcuata-1971(1).jpg,255

Three young girls can be seen playing chess in the foreground, while an older woman, perhaps the Anguissola family's maid, is sitting behind them and watching their game. On the left, the artist's younger sister, Elena, gazes calmly towards the viewer while her hands indicate that she has just defeated her sister who sits on the right. Minerva, with her hand raised in defeat and disbelief, gazes with parted lips at the conqueror. The youngest girl, Europa, stands beside Elena and grins cheekily at the despondent loser. Her laughing expression recalls the drawing of the laughing girl in Boy Bitten by a Crawfish that Michelangelo had so admired, and perhaps this was Anguissola's sly way of immortalising her praised work. The painter has masterfully captured the details in the elaborate clothing of her sisters, using her pigments to highlight the braids wrapped around their heads, or the ruffled collars under their chins.

Through her paintbrush Anguissola has transformed a mundane, everyday interaction between sisters into drama. She used the scene to depict a number of artistic genres and skills including landscapes, fabric textures, and the human face at different stages of life, perhaps to highlight the scope of her talent. The landscape and detail on the oak tree behind the girls display her skill at depicting flora, while the chessboard and table with its Turkish carpet that butts up against the frame and into the viewer's space is not only showcasing her power in depicting still life but also seems to have influenced the later painter, Caravaggio, who often used jutting elbows, table corners and dirty feet to protrude into his audience's space.

As a woman in Renaissance Italy, it was thought to be too indecent for her to study the naked human form from life, and so the grander historical paintings or Biblical portraits such as St Sebastian, Adam and Eve or the death of Caesar were considered too racy. Thus, many of Anguissola's earlier work focuses on family members and self-portraits. But, like in this case, the subject is often given an unexpected dimension: her sisters here play a game of skill and strategy that hints at their intellectual potential.",1024,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/sofonisba-anguissola/lucia-minerva-and-europa-anguissola-playing-chess-1555.jpg,809

Guggenheim Museum, New York City, NY, US']",[],"After Kenzo Okada relocated from Tokyo to New York in 1950, his work came to represent a melding of Japanese traditions and American abstract trends. Rather than striving for pure abstraction, his work from the 1950s could be called “semi-abstract,” evoking the natural world through carefully composed form and a decidedly muted palette. These works are subtle, quiet, and poetic—more meditative in nature than the energetic gestural abstractions of some of his American-born counterparts. The composition of Decision (1956) is also organized to suggest natural topography. Blocky, softly defined shapes organically arrange the canvas into rough horizontal registers, creating a panoramic quality reminiscent of landscape painting. Meanwhile, small, irregular shapes hover and tumble rhythmically across the stable ground. Okada thus seeks a balance between heavy and delicate, tangible and abstract.",490,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/kenzo-okada/decision-1956.jpg,416

Hesse called Hang Up her earliest important artistic ""statement"", due to its successful manifestation of her fascination with ""absurdity."" The wire juts out seemingly too far into the space before the ""picture"", and the cloth-wrapped frame of the canvas contrasts strongly with the metal loop. The soft and hard textures are subtle testaments to the self-contradictory nature of much of Hesse's sculpture, keeping any given work's meaning shrouded in mystery. The rod protruding from the canvas might even be said to evoke the erotic, as did the orbs in Ringaround Arosie.

Guggenheim Museum, New York City, NY, US']",['Line'],"Baziotes shared his keen interest in nature with other artists of the New York School, who were motivated simultaneously by their search for primordial truths and their fascination with scientific inquiry. What bridged these two utopian investigations was the microscope; the invisible world of protean forms it revealed promised to disclose the origins of life. This preoccupation with identifying metaphysical features of the organic realm may illuminate Baziotes's predilection for marine imagery, as demonstrated in Aquatic (1961), a painting of serpentine forms swimming through a calm, watery world. The symbolic possibilities of the ocean are vast and Baziotes drew on many of its meanings. Aquatic has been interpreted as an expression of the artist's romantic vision of the sea as a domain of symbiotic relationships. The artist was captivated by the mating practice of eels, which swim through the ocean, rarely touching but always together. The delicately intertwined lines in the picture have been thought to represent these faithful eels on their course through the watery depths.

In this work, Shiraga cultivates the same energy and dynamic action of his barefoot action paintings, radicalizing and extending the notion of painting even further. Here, he completely relinquishes the canvas, paint, conventional materials and museum space, using his body not as a tool for applying paint, but as a direct means of interaction with the material. Both the painting in the mud and the artist’s body become sites of action. Shiraga emerges from the work cut and bruised and covered with mud; as he acts on the mud, the mud likewise acts on him. In this sense, the work embodies the emphasis of the Gutai on the engagement of the artist with the material in such a way that he “shakes hands” with it. The artist ultimately relinquishes the mastery of control over the material and enters into partnership with it. Staging his act of creation for visitors to the exhibition to witness, Shiraga furthermore articulates the importance placed by the Gutai on the process of creation rather than on the works themselves. He transforms painting into a process-oriented medium and actually “performs” his work. Nevertheless, the Gutai artists intended their actions to result in the creation of paintings. Shiraga conceived of Challenging Mud as a painting, which is evidenced by the exhibition of the work alongside other paintings, complete with an exhibition label. He says of the work, “I painted the same way I had painted with my feet but with my whole body to create a painting: I had no intention of making a three-dimensional work.” While photographic documentation records the action, for Shiraga, Challenging Mud is essentially a painting made with his body.

It depicts an array of famous Roman monuments in a rural setting. Panini was a famed painter of capriccios, architectural fantasies. In this case, he combined a staggering array of monuments by Romans without regard to topography. From left to right, he included the Temple of Hadrian, the Pantheon, the Temple of Vesta, the Maison Carrée, and the Theater of Marcellus, all of them surrounding the Obelisk of Thutmose III. In front of this overabundance of history, he placed the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, around which contemporary Roman peasants carry out their business. While quite cavalier with regards to geography, Panini was remarkably faithful in his architectural reconstructions. He carefully edited out later additions to the original buildings, such as the walled-in sections in the arches of the Theater of Marcellus and Bernini's bell towers on the Pantheon's pediment.

Panini's earliest training was with a painter of theatrical scenery, and certain elements of that early influence can be seen in this painting. The arrangement of monuments is very similar to the way architectural perspective was achieved in the Italian theater. At the front of the ""stage"" are the peasant-actors in quaint costumes. Fashionable European youths undertook the Grand Tour throughout the eighteenth century, and for half a century to either side, and liked to bring back souvenirs of their travels. Thus, sketches and paintings of landmarks such as those in the Capriccio were very lucrative for Panini and his contemporaries. Escapism and contemplation were more important than geographical accuracy, so Panini was free to rearrange scenery in paintings like this. This creative reorganization led to a better comprehension of the ideal, rather than current, conditions of the monuments and the civilization that made them.

The IMA received Roman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments and its pendant, The Colosseum and Other Monuments in 1950, as gifts of Lila Allison Lilly in memory of her husband, Josiah Kirby Lilly. Both are currently on view in the Jane H. Fortune Gallery.

Kennedy. Produced in the winter of 1963, the painting cycle Nine Discourses on Commodus serves as a summation of this agonized and singular phase in his career. The cycle is based on the cruelty, insanity, and eventual murder of the Roman emperor Aurelius Commodus (161–192 CE). Conflict, opposition, and tension dominate the paintings' composition. Two whorls of matter hold the central focus of each piece, ranging in mood from serene, cloudlike structures to bleeding wounds and culminating in a fiery apotheosis in the final panel. Despite the paintings' intrinsic aesthetics of chaos and instability, a tightly controlled armature governs their composition. The gray background acts as a negative space to counterbalance the bloody whirls of paint and scabs of congealed impasto. Over this neutral backdrop, the line that runs along the middle of the paintings serves as a guiding mark to subdivide the composition. Many of the Commodus paintings also feature numerical sequences, often articulating the grids, graphs, and geometric axes that form the paintings' skeleton.

The Commodus paintings were first exhibited at Leo Castelli Gallery in New York in March 1964, appearing before an American audience still in the thrall of Pop art and Minimalism. In this context, Twombly's messy and esoteric Commodus paintings seemed severely out of place and out of date. They attracted scathing reviews, which tellingly focused on Twombly's absence from the New York art scene, implying his abandonment of the United States and carrying the distinctly chauvinistic subtext that these paintings had been imported from ""old Europe."" Given their intrinsic reliance on narrative and sequence, it can hardly have helped the situation that the Commodus paintings were installed in a jumbled and confused order at Castelli Gallery, leaving their overall trajectory undecipherable.""

The earthy palette evokes a subterranean landscape. The figure of the miner pushing his wheelbarrow dominates the composition, balancing the angular geometric forms: a brick wall, smoke stack, a rectangular building with an arched doorway, and a conical mountain that looms in the distance. Manmade forms create a pattern of alternating diagonals in the background. Orozco Romero’s treatment of the subject defies the political rhetoric of the 1920s and later, in which the suffering of the worker was often emphasized. Executed shortly after he moved permanently to Mexico City, the subject of this oil was surely inspired by the monumental works he encountered there. But whereas Rivera, in his murals in the Patio of Labor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública, showcased the martyrdom of the miner, Orozco Romero created a dynamic composition whose main purpose was to juxtapose the softened human form with the angularity of the emerging industrial landscape. However, one element—the “halo” around the worker’s head—suggests that Orozco Romero was not unsympathetic to his subject.”

One day, frightened for no apparent reason other than that of a power cut which inconvenienced and possibly frightened the sisters, they brutally murdered the mother and daughter of the family while the man of the house was out at work. In working with the story, Paula Rego seems to have focused on the unnatural closeness of the sisters, both to each other and the mother and daughter they murder. Ambiguity and menacing psychosis reverberate within the picture, much of it carried in the objects with which the room is claustrophobically furnished.

We might also see in this work the playful, absurd qualities of Dada, as well as the more fantastic, futuristic elements of late Bauhaus as manifested in the abstract theatrical costumes of Oskar Schlemmer and others of pre-war German design culture. Hesse has identified the two central objects as a breast and a penis, which lends the work a humorous quality; at the same time, the relief exudes a stereotypically feminine persona with its pink tonality and craft-like texture. The title, which recalls a well-known childhood game with a haunting subtext referring to ""falling down"" or similarly suffering a calamity, has been interpreted as a statement of Hesse's own desire at that time to become a mother. As if giving birth to another dimension in her own work, this first relief by Hesse is an important landmark in her evolving path from painting to so-called ""eccentric"" sculpture.",550,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/eva-hesse/ringaround-arosie-1965.jpg,861

[i]Lunatics[/i] should be understood in the context of Nerdrum’s body of work, as it built upon ideas the artist explored in earlier paintings. In the early phases of his career, Nerdrum focused on contemporary subjects and everyday reality. However, by the early 1980s his subject matter drastically changed. The artist began constructing a new world which described a primordial and archetypal existence. In the beginning his paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/the-ultimate-sight-1985][i]The Ultimate Sight[/i][/url] (1985) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/return-of-the-sun][i]Return of the Sun[/i][/url] (1986-1995) depicted some type of ritualistic activity, and later paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/pregnant-women-with-followers-1999][i]Pregnant Women with Followers[/i][/url] (1999) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/sleeping-prophet-2000][i]Sleeping Prophet[/i][/url] (2000) showed a group led by a prophet figure.

[i]Lunatics[/i] is situated in a similar kind of reality. Ten figures are scattered in a barren landscape wearing strange garbs: cloaks, armor, fancy headdresses and helmets. However, unlike the aforementioned paintings, there is no clear leader or purposeful activity taking place. The group in [i]Lunatics[/i] is in a state of repose: they are all waiting, but each figure is on its own, isolated from the other individuals in the vast space. This state of alienation is also seen in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/dawn-1990][i]Dawn[/i][/url] (1990), where four identical figures are turned sideways with their mouths gaping. The sense of isolation in [i]Dawn[/i] is expressed through the mute screams, but no such aggressiveness is apparent in [i]Lunatics[/i]. In contrast to the tight composition of [i]Dawn[/i], [i]Lunatics[/i] has a tremendous sense of space and depth, of the never-ending landscape. It also has a rich color palette of deep violets, and scarlets, and tones of blue, that harmoniously play against shades of ochre and gold. The scenery in [i]Lunatics[/i] is consistent with the desolate environment shown in [i]Dawn[/i] and other paintings. This type of landscape, also seen in [i]Dawn[/i], was likely based on the Nerdrum’s extensive studies of the Icelandic landscape. This barren environment, scarce in resources, is often a backdrop for scenes of violence like in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/iron-law-1984][i]Iron Law[/i][/url] (1983-1984) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/woman-kills-injured-man][i]Woman Killing Injured Man[/i][/url] (1994). In [i]Lunatics[/i] Nerdrum evolves to another phase. Although there is a sense of alienation in [i]Lunatics[/i], there is also a feeling of togetherness, or at least a desire for community and family. According to scholar Matthew Ballou, the group in [i]Lunatics[/i] is in a meditative state. Their silence can be interpreted as spiritual or ritual, like a congregation in the Eucharist.

Nerdrum’s paintings aim to tell the essential nature of human experiences. The first stages of community and the human desire for unity depicted in [i]Lunatics[/i] is more explicit in Nerdrum’s works like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/flock][i]Flock[/i][/url] (2006) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/wanderers-by-the-sea][i]Wanderers by the Sea[/i][/url] (2000). [i]Lunatics[/i] captures the experience of isolation, but at the same time hints at the basic human desire to create community and eventually society.",960,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/odd-nerdrum/lunatics-2001.jpg,554

In a letter to the compiler dated 25 January 1990, the artist described this series as ‘more open-ended than some of my earlier work, where the forms were developed through a more gradual metamorphosis’. This painting consists of thinly poured layers of paint, built up to form a dark ground on which the artist has placed a black, sprawling, freely painted shape. The edges of the canvas provide evidence of lilac, white, yellow and orange underpainting. In three of the corners Hoyland has introduced more thickly painted circular forms. These are painted in two or more shades of red (top right), yellow (bottom right) and orange (bottom left). This third disc is almost cancelled by a dark swirl of black over-painting. In his letter to the compiler the artist said that 'Gadal 10.11.86' was painted in his studio at Charterhouse Square, London. The painting process involved building up the paint in layers over a number of days, so that each new pouring modified or enhanced the preceding colours. The shapes were then added, in a heavier impasto, which was in turn reworked, so that a resolution between figure and ground was found. Hoyland wrote he did not think that he had made any small related canvases or works on paper ‘except for small drawings which I always make to examine possibilities on a large scale’.

When 'Gadal 10.11.86' was first exhibited, John McEwen wrote in the catalogue that Hoyland's aim in his art ‘has always been the greater liberation of form and colour’. McEwen noted that a pattern had emerged, whereby one series of paintings tended to build up a particular form, while the next broke it down. Out of this fragmentation emerged the new form. He described how the rectangular compositions of the 1970s grew almost to the margins of the canvas, and were then pushed back to the diagonal and were finally fragmented into a series of smaller rectangles. These in turn became less defined and were gradually transformed into triangles which, when broken down, gave birth to the circles of the extended series to which Gadal belongs.",962,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/john-hoyland/gadal-10-11-86-1986.jpg,966

focuses on a woman in traditional dress, representing Greece.  Her arms are raised in a gesture 
of horror and helplessness as she surveys the scene of mass suicide of her patriots who chose 
death rather than surrender to the Turks.  The painting commemorates the people of 
Missolonghi and is symbolic of freedom against tyrannical rule. 

Caulfield deliberately chose to work from a black and white reproduction of the Delacroix 
painting so that the colours would be left to his imagination. He used a limited range of 
household gloss paints, substituting flat areas of colour for Delacroix’s more emotive 
brushstrokes. ",880,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/patrick-caulfield/greece-expiring-on-the-ruins-of-missolonghi-after-delacroix-1963.jpg,1100

In a painting of monumental scale (253x182.2 cm), Ofili created his version of the Madonna: powerful, black, and sexual. Ofili explained that he found the traditional interpretations of the Virgin Mary painted by Old Masters to be sexually charged. In his version, he wanted to depict a hip hop Madonna. In [i]The Holy Virgin Mary[/i], he alluded to traditional iconography and imagery of the Virgin. Still, at the same time, he manipulated these conventions by injecting elements of irony and humor into the work.

The background, shimmering orange resin with glitter, is reminiscent of the gold leaf used in religious icons, and the small glittery dots give the effect of halo around the figure. The figure is surrounded by what from a distance appear to be butterflies, but are, in fact, cutouts of female genitalia from pornographic magazines. The pornographic cutouts reference images of black women in gangsta rap music and serve as a contrast to the sacred image and subject. The placement of the cutouts can also ironically reference images of [i]putti[/i] - nude chubby children with wings that were frequently depicted with the Holy Virgin in Renaissance paintings.

The Madonna adorns a blue robe, a traditional attribute of the Virgin Mary, with one of her breasts exposed. Ofili applied a round piece of dried, varnished elephant dung to mark her breast. He also used two balls of resin-covered elephant dung to prop up the painting, instead of taking the traditional approach of hanging it on the wall. The artist incorporated elephant dung in other paintings from the period, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/double-captain-shit-and-the-legend-of-the-black-stars-1997][i]Double Captain Shit and the Legend of the Black Stars[/i][/url] (1997) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/no-woman-no-cry-1998][i]No Woman No Cry[/i][/url] (1998). This practice was inspired by his first visit to Africa in 1992. He was struck by the energy of the African natural environment, and by applying the elephant dung onto the canvas, he found a way to incorporate the environment into his art. The elephant dung, widely used in Africa as a fertilizer, can be interpreted as a symbol of growth and motherhood.

The use of the elephant dung was what grabbed headlines and caused a big stir in 1999 when the painting traveled to the Brooklyn Museum as part of the exhibition [i]Sensation[/i]. The mayor of New York City at the time, Rudy Giuliani, tried to stop the painting from being shown by withholding funding from the Brooklyn Museum. The museum, however, did not budge: they sued the city and eventually won the court case. Furthermore, during the exhibition, the painting was vandalized by a man named Dennis Heiner, who managed to bypass security barriers and spray the canvas with white paint. Ultimately the controversy surrounding the painting raised Ofili’s international profile and solidified his position in the art world. While it is unknown to what extent the artist intended to provoke audiences with [i]The Holy Virgin Mary[/i], he certainly created a potent image that contrasted between profane and sacred. Additionally, it was important for Ofili to make a black Madonna. In the painting, he combined different facets of black culture: African heritage and American hip hop culture.",400,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/chris-ofili/the-holy-virgin-mary-1996.jpg,525

It belongs to the early phase of his career when he was imitating the style of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and displays a characteristic use of strong colour. Around 1870, Stanhope turned to painting allegories inspired by the Italian Renaissance in the manner of Edward Burne-Jones (1833-98), of whom he is considered to be the most important follower.
Thoughts of the Past, a modern-life subject, was painted in the studio below that of D.G. Rossetti (1828-82) beside the Thames at Chatham Place, London. Stanhope's portrayal of a prostitute in her lodging, who is suddenly overcome with remorse for her situation, reproduces the theme of the guilt-ridden prostitute that was prevalent in literature and paintings of the 1850s and 1860s, especially among the Pre-Raphaelites and their followers. Holman Hunt's (1827-1910) The Awakening Conscience (1853-4), is another example. A study for Thoughts of the Past  reveals that Stanhope had originally conceived the woman with her eyes raised skyward, as if in silent prayer, thus emphasising the idea of her repentance.
Thoughts of the Past may be viewed in terms of what the art historian Lynda Nead has identified as the 'seduction to suicide mythology', that was built around the figure of the prostitute in the nineteenth century (Nead, p.169). The interior of the room is replete with signs of a fall from virtue ; the gaudy cloak and shabby dressing table, the jewellery and money strewn across it, and the man's glove and walking stick on the floor. A number of sickly-looking plants reach up to catch the light from a window, which is open and threatens to let in a plume of black soot from outside. The view, which looks out towards Waterloo Bridge, with the Strand (a popular haunt of prostitutes) on the right, alludes to both the woman's corruption and her impending doom. The woman's red hair may associate her with images of Mary Magadalen, the archetypal prostitute. Prostitution was seen to pose a threat to the domestic core of Victorian society and representations engage in a complex language of urban filth and disease, of which the Thames, chronically polluted and stinking at the time this work was painted, was a familiar image. Death was assumed to be the only means of redemption for the prostitute and suicide by drowning, the most commonly imagined scenario, was implied through the depiction of the River and its bridges.

To produce this work, the artist and his assistants engaged in repetitive and communal labor that systematized and broke down the artistic process into stages of production: the creation of molds, the casting of plaster, and the application of enamel paint to create a smooth surface with no trace of the artist’s hand. Although the panels were all executed in this way, no two share the same dimensions and frame color. Handmade but standardized, Collection of Forty Plaster Surrogates integrates art and mass production, challenging conventional distinctions between these types of labor.",500,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/allan-mccollum/collection-of-forty-plaster-surrogates-1982.jpg,326

It was based on a much smaller version of the same scene, presently held by the Yale University Art Gallery. Trumbull painted many of the figures in the picture from life and visited Independence Hall as well to depict the chamber where the Second Continental Congress met. The oil-on-canvas work was commissioned in 1817, purchased in 1819, and placed in the rotunda in 1826.

The painting is sometimes incorrectly described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. In fact, the painting actually shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.

The painting shows 42 of the 56 signers of the Declaration; Trumbull originally intended to include all 56 signers, but was unable to obtain likenesses for all of them. He also decided to depict several participants in the debate who did not sign the document, including John Dickinson, who declined to sign. Because the Declaration was debated and signed over a period of time when membership in Congress changed, the men in the painting had never all been in the same room at the same time.

Thomas Jefferson seems to be stepping on the foot of John Adams in the painting, which many think is supposed to symbolize their relationship as political enemies. However, upon closer examination of the painting, it can be seen that their feet are merely close together. This part of the image was correctly depicted on the two-dollar bill version.",1827,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/john-trumbull/declaration-of-independence-1819.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

While the polished resin surface captures the aesthetic of surfing and car culture unique to Southern California in the 1960s, the title was drawn from advertising slogans in fashion magazines. The work’s interaction with both the floor and wall is meant to call attention to the space occupied in the gallery by both viewer and object. “I see the plank as existing between two worlds,” McCracken has said, “the floor representing the physical world of standing objects, trees, cars, buildings, human bodies, and everything, and the wall representing the world of the imagination, illusionistic painting space, human mental space, and all that.”",302,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/john-mccracken/the-absolutely-naked-fragrance-1967.jpg,420

It is located southeast of the Liquid Crystal Institute building on the Kent State University main campus.

Shortly after the Kent State shootings, which took place on May 4, 1970, an inscription was added to the artwork that recontextualized the work in such a way that it came to be associated by some with the event.

It is firmly attributed to Pisanello on stylistic grounds and because he stayed in Ferrara in the period, where he also finished a portrait and a celebrative medal of Marquis Leonello d'Este. The princess is shown in profile against a background of numerous butterflies and columbine flowers. The butterfly near the princess' brow is a symbol of the soul.

The discovery of a whole collection of these self-composed songs in an old suitcase after Sekoto’s death, led to the production of a musical CD titled ‘The Blue Heads’ by The Sekoto Foundation under the guidance of Barbara Lindop. Paris, the “City of Light”, was a beacon of artistic freedom from the early 1920’s and lured thousands of artists, musicians and writers, many of whom were political or cultural exiles, to experience its cordial racial and artistic climate. Sekoto was one of these cultural asylum-seekers having left South Africa under self-imposed exile in 1947. Handicapped by being black, poor and not knowing the language or culture – an unknown artist painting in a cold, dark hotel room – Sekoto’s first years in Paris were a battle for survival.

Following World War II Boulevard St Germain, located on the Left Bank, across the Seine from the Tuileries, rivaled Boulevard Montparnasse as the intellectual center of Paris. There are few countries in the world to rival France in its respect for Jazz musicians and Jazz as an art form. By virtue of this, Sekoto was able to find employment at l’Echelle de Jacob (Jacob’s ladder) – one of Paris’ trendy nightclubs at the time – when the owner heard him play the piano at an audition he had stumbled upon. By using thick impasto brushstrokes to accentuate the rhythmic composition of angular shapes, Sekoto creates a visual beat in ‘Jazz Band’. His palette is dominated by grey and blue hues, recreating the smoky haze of the underground nightclub scene. The tight composition echoes the confined cellar space, and draws the viewer in as if seated at a table, nodding approvingly while listening to the live music.

Commenting on this painting, Sekoto said: I played for a students’ café, then various other bars where the clients had more money and where the French and tourists paid more. This is one of the St Germain nightclub cellars. The players are not my pals nor was the picture done on the spot .

'I did not know how to paint this and returned home with a vivid impression, with the sensation of the interaction of these two complementary colours, red and green, when they are found together: red, when it meets its complementary, green, becomes ultra-red and explodes... green, on the other hand, remains calm, silent and immobile.'",1068,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/gerardo-dottori/explosion-of-red-on-green-1910.jpg,750

He was writing from Dieppe where he had arrived a few days earlier with his friend Frosca Munster. The Normandy port, renowned for its scallops and herrings brought in by the fishing fleet, had attracted many artists, notably Walter Sickert (1862-1942) who had painted the buildings of the town, and Georges Braque (1882-1963). Braque had visited Dieppe in 1928, and built a house and a small studio in nearby Varengeville the following year. He painted the foreshore and studies of small boats, which Wood may have seen. Furthermore Dieppe would have reminded Wood of St Ives, where he had stayed with his friends Ben (1894-1982) and Winifred Nicholson (1893-1981) a few months earlier. There he had become fascinated with boats and the traditional life of fishing communities, a subject that was to become a recurring theme in his paintings during his last years.
A Fishing Boat in Dieppe Harbour is characteristic of many of Wood's paintings from the late 1920s. Many art historians, including Charles Harrison, have made comparisons between these paintings and the work of Alfred Wallis (1855-1942). Wood had met Wallis, a reclusive seventy year old Cornish fisherman, whilst staying in St Ives in 1928. Harrison suggests that, following frequent visits to Wallis's studio to see his naïve paintings of sailing boats on irregular shaped pieces of cardboard and wood, Wood's paintings became 'more robust in shape and colour' (Harrison, p.189). Wood's interest in the design of Wallis's little pictures is evident from the manner in which he allows the boat to dominate the composition. In addition, as Ingleby remarked, the boat 'is poised at an angle to the sea, like an object on a table top' (Ingleby, p.213). This enabled Wood, who himself was an experienced sailor, to include details of the equipment and rigging. Behind the harbour wall he paints the tall cliffs, the homes of the fishermen in Le Pollet and a weather vane, which appears to be out of scale to the rest of the scene. In contrast to many of the pictures Wood made at Dieppe, in which he used a neutral palette of black, white, greys and creams, A Fishing Boat in Dieppe Harbour is richly coloured. The turquoise sea and threatening grey sky contrasts with the brightly coloured houses and yellow wooden boards in the boat.
A preparatory drawing for this painting in the collection of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums reveals that, despite its childlike appearance, Wood thought carefully about the composition of the finished work. Sophie Barthelemy suggests that he 'integrated it [the boat] fully into a complex interplay of lines, and colours values, creating a composition that is at once densely structured and rigorously simplified' .",1507,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/christopher-wood/a-fishing-boat-in-dieppe-harbour-1929.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

57728227edc2cb3880f6c4b3,Room 19,room-19-1968,imi-knoebel,Knoebel Imi,57726db0edc2cb3880b4dc1b,1968.0,"['57726b52edc2cb3880ad76a8', '57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e78']",,,,['installation'],['Minimalism'],[],,,,[],"['Room', 'Furniture', 'Floor', 'Hardwood']","Raum 19 (Room 19), 1968, is a key work in Imi Knoebel's oeuvre, prescient of his mature aesthetic and practice. Created while he was still a Meister-student under Joseph Beuys, it took its title from the place of its execution, the number of his studio in the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf.1 All seventy-seven parts— stretchers, planar elements, stereometric and rectangular volumes—are fabricated from wood and fiberboard, which has been used ""raw,"" in an untreated state; the pristine condition of these simple geometric components gives the impression that they await future deployment. A commonplace building material then rarely used for the making of artworks, Masonite soon became one of Knoebel's preferred materials on account of its quotidian serviceability and ready availability. This humble ordinariness, together with the straightforward carpentry techniques it presupposes, signals his belief that the artist's practice is as banal and pragmatic as that of a farm laborer, an urban worker, or an architect. Notwithstanding his abiding reverence for Kasimir Malevich and Beuys, he claims that an artist's role today has little to do with that of a visionary creator inspired by mystical beliefs.

Also prophetic of much of Knoebel's later work is the way these ineluctably nonobjective forms elide the realm of painting with those of sculpture and architecture. But not only does Raum 19 dispense with illusion in favor of corporeal presence, it also restricts metaphoric and referential content. From the stretchers and stretcher parts to the picture frames, from the variously scaled planar surfaces, in the guise of both individual ""canvases"" and sections of mural-sized compositions, to the bland, simple sculptural volumes, it arrays the constituents and components of a painterly practice reduced to its rudimentary essentials: form, material, surface, space, support. Given its embrace of both the plastic and the tectonic, Raum 19 may also serve as an ideal model for a creative revisioning of the world, but Knoebel's works never create a metastructure of reality: ""[They] take part in this world as things,"" Christoph Schenker argues. Moreover, in seeking to function as ""instruments of the pure experience of 'image,' excluded from the realm of language,"" they remain, he contends, ""at the very limits of communicability.""

The polymorphous elements of Raum 19 can be variously assembled depending on the context, that is, depending on the gallery space and the artist's impulses. Since no fixed set of relationships binds the components, the work can expand to an environmental scale or may be densely compacted so that it appears as if in storage, as was the case when Knoebel exhibited it at Dia's exhibition facility in New York City, in 1987, alongside a range of other works. Given that the ensemble is permutable, and that its particular configuration, dimensions, and internal relations are dependent on the artist's decisions in situ, form becomes an event—sometimes chaotic, sometimes ordered; sometimes impenetrable, sometimes lucid; sometimes austere, sometimes abundant; sometimes confined, sometimes boundless. Though unique, every event remains contingent. Since any single installation is only ever one among innumerable possible compositions in this open system, emphasis shifts to notions of presentation per se, to staging as an abstract condition.

He also traveled to San Francisco, where he took photographs of the city's streets and landmarks. These included the Golden Gate Bridge, the famous suspension bridge that extends more than 4,000 feet across the entrance to the San Francisco Bay. Sheeler executed this painting in early 1955, working from his photographs, at his home in Irvington, New York. His evocation of the bridge is partially abstract, due to its simplified forms, heightened color palette, and extreme viewpoint. In addition, Sheeler may have devised the composition by superimposing two photographic negatives at a slight overlap. Golden Gate conveys the sensation of passing along the bridge, beneath its towers and suspension cables; the further tower rises like a ladder, with its cross-spans suggesting ""rungs"" against an intensely blue sky.

This late work by Sheeler is at once a formal experiment, a tribute to a specific landmark, and a more generalized symbol of travel and opportunity. In a letter to Robert Beverly Hale, curator of American paintings at the Metropolitan Museum, Sheeler wrote, ""I hope the title 'Golden Gate' will remain, it conveys my thought. More fluid than if bridge were added, then it would be limited to be the connecting link between two dots on the map. It is an opening to wherever the spectator thinks desirable.""",650,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/charles-sheeler/golden-gate-1955.jpg,474

The sculpture refers to the biblical story of the young and untrained David bringing down Goliath, the giant, and the strongest Philistine warrior. David’s triumph, made possible through God’s help, symbolizes good conquering evil. Scholars have vigorously debated many aspects of the statue: its date, original location, and the underlying meaning behind the style and iconography. The suggested dates of creation range from the 1420s to the 1460s; however, most scholars believe the date to be around 1440. The first mention of the statue stated that it was located in the courtyard of the Medici Palace in 1469. Given this, the majority of scholars agree that the sculpture was commissioned by Cosimo de’ Medici for the courtyard of the Medici Palace. Later scholars discovered that the statue was once accompanied by an inscription: “[i]The victor is whoever defends the fatherland. God crushes the wrath of an enormous foe. Behold! A boy overcomes a great tyrant. Conquer, o citizens![/i]”.

Depictions of a triumphant David were rare in 14th-century Italian art. Earlier, Donatello created a marble version of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/david-1409][i]David[/i][/url] (1408-1409), which introduced a new approach to the subject, depicting David as a military hero and a slayer of tyrants. This shift was linked to the changing political climate in Florence at the turn of the 15th century, and in 1416 the marble [i]David[/i] was placed at the Palazzo della Signoria (today Palazzo Vecchio), the government seat of Florence. Like David defeating Goliath, the rulers of Florence wished to present themselves as liberators that defeated tyranny. It meant that David became a political symbol, associated with the liberation of Florence, and its triumph over political enemies. Even though Donatello’s bronze [i]David[/i] is significantly different than his marble [i]David[/i], a precedent existed for using David as a political symbol. The combination of the recently discovered inscription, location of the statue (the most public space in the palace of the family that held political power), and practice of using David as a symbol of political power explains the political significance of Donatello’s bronze [i]David[/i].

However, the bronze [i]David[/i] is very distinct in its style and portrayal: he is naked, wearing only a helmet and boots, leaning casually on his sword. Donatello emphasized his youth, giving David a slender figure and an androgynous appearance. These physical attributes seem to be a peculiar choice for a statue associated with the strength of Florentine’s political rule. One way to explain this choice is to examine it in the context of the humanist awakening in Florence during the first half of the 15th century, as well as Donatello’s interest in humanism and antiquity. Texts like Plato’s [i]Symposium[/i] describe the idea of ‘platonic love’ through the relationship between an older man and a younger boy. It is possible that Plato’s description of younger boys and their beauty inspired Donatello to create a portrayal of David that expressed the power of ‘platonic love.’ Also, this depiction emphasized the potency of David’s triumph: a young boy that killed a tyrant through divine intervention.",676,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/donatello/david-1432(1).jpg!HD.jpg,1200

It is a portrait of Jane Burden, Morris's soon-to-be wife, and it is believed that he started work on it very early during their courtship. The picture has been identified in the past as [i]Queen Guenevere[/i], partly owing to the fact that Morris published his first volume of poetry, [i]The Defence of Guenevere[/i], in March 1858. However, recent research has established convincingly that the picture is intended to represent Iseult mourning Tristram's exile from the court of King Mark.

The story of [i]Tristram and Iseult[/i] (Tristan and Isolde) is a legend of Celtic origin made famous during the medieval period by the treatment of Thomas Mallory, on which Morris based his composition. Iseult appears to have recently arisen from her bed, where a small greyhound lies curled up among the crumpled sheets. She stands wistfully in her small chamber, her feelings for Tristram reinforced by the sprigs of rosemary, symbolizing remembrance, in her crown, and the word [i]'DOLOURS[/i]' (grief) written down the side of her mirror.

The rich colors, the emphasis on pattern, and details such as the illuminated missal reveal where Morris's true talents lay. He was less at home with figure painting than with illumination, embroidery, and woodcarving, and he struggled for months on this picture. Many of the furnishings, such as the Turkish rug, Persian embroidered cover, and whitework hangings on the bed, were probably in Morris's personal collection. 

The narrative of doomed lovers contains all the aspects of Medieval romance - thwarted desire, virtue, honor, chivalry - that attracted the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood]Pre-Raphaelites[/url] to the literature and art of the period. In the scene depicted, Iseult is mourning the exile of Tristram - a knight sent to fetch her from Ireland to marry King Mark of Cornwall, only for the two to fall in love en route - from her husband's court. The tale was one that Morris had previously represented in the Oxford Union Murals, and the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite artists with whom he undertook that project, particularly [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti]Rossetti[/url], is evident. At the same time, we might trace a thread of affinity with the nascent [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/symbolism]Symbolist[/url] movement in continental Europe, given the heavily allegorical nature of the composition. The dog on the bed, given to Iseult by Tristram in Mallory's story, stands for loyalty, the rosemary in her crown for remembrance.

The painting also alludes in various ways to Morris's artistic and personal biography. While figural painting would never be his true calling, we can sense clues as to his future endeavors as a designer and craftsman in the finer details of the scene. On the bed is an illuminated manuscript similar to those Morris would produce with Kelmscott Press. At the same time, the lavish textiles and tapestries are reminiscent of those Morris would spend most of his career creating. As for his model, Jane's strong, striking features, which epitomized the Pre-Raphaelite ideal of beauty, also caught the attention of Morris's friend and mentor Rossetti, with whom Jane embarked on a lifelong affair, grudgingly tolerated by her husband.",739,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/william-morris/la-belle-iseult-1858.jpg,1000

Heade made significant contributions to floral still-life painting during the course of his career, the NGA points out, with Giant Magnolias being one of the finest. Heade married in 1883 and settled in St. Augustine, Florida after a lackluster career as an itinerant artist. He was patronized by Floridian Henry Morrison Flagler, an oil and railroad magnate, who regularly purchased his works. The NGA believes this personal and professional stability stimulated the production of the still-life paintings of Heade's last years.

The NGA writes, ""Certainly works such as Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth, with their striking contrasts of brilliantly lit flowers and leaves set against a dark background, are among the most original still lifes of the nineteenth century. They are also for many observers strongly sensual, their lush colors, full, curving contours, overall sense of opulence, and implied perfumed scent of the flowers suggestive, perhaps, of female nudes languidly reclining on luxurious couches.""",610,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/martin-johnson-heade/giant-magnolias-on-a-blue-velvet-cloth-1890.jpg,382

But instead of choosing a traditional view of a sitting room, bedroom or dining room, Caulfield has focussed on a confined area that is the junction between a landing and two corridors.

All the elements are perspectivally correct, but greatly simplified. The effect is to make the space seem simultaneously real and cartoon-like. Although the distance between the viewer and the furthest point in the scene is perhaps no more than twelve feet, there is nevertheless a strong sense of depth within the picture. This is because the foreground, middle ground and background are strongly delineated by the architecture and divide the canvas into thirds.

Caulfield's domestic interiors are often lifted directly from 1950s interior decorating magazines and they retain their original aspirational mood. Devoid of narrative, Caulfield nevertheless imbues each canvas with a powerful emotional register by suffusing them with a dominant saturated colour. Frequently melancholic, these interiors are always totally still and without a human presence except maybe for a light left on.

Many of his interior scenes also play with methods of portraying different forms, combinations and sources of light. He also incorporates trompe d'oeil and photorealistic elements in order to playfully explore the relationship between notions of reality, artifice and illusion. Caulfield was interested in showing how no one method of representation within an artwork can claim to be more or less 'real' than another.

The painting shows an elderly black man teaching a boy, assumed to be his grandson, how to play the banjo. This deceptively simple-looking work explores several important themes. Blacks had long been stereotyped as entertainers in American culture, and the image of a black man playing the banjo appears throughout American art of the late 19th century. Thomas Worth, Willy Miller, Walter M. Dunk, Eastman Johnson, and Tanner’s teacher Thomas Eakins had tackled the subject in their artwork.
These images are often reduced to a minstrel-type portrayal. Tanner painted a sensitive reinterpretation. Instead of a generalization, the painting portrays a specific moment of human interaction. The two characters concentrate intently on the task before them. They seem to be oblivious to the rest of the world, which enlarges the sense of real contact and cooperation. The skillfully painted portraits of the individuals make it obvious that these are real people and not types.
In addition to being a meaningful exploration of human qualities, the piece is masterfully painted. Tanner undertakes the difficult endeavor of portraying two separate and varying light sources. A natural white, blue glow from outside enters from the left while the warm light from a fireplace is apparent on the right. The figures are illuminated where the two light sources meet; some have hypothesized this as a manifestation of Tanner’s situation in transition between two worlds, his American past and his newfound home in France.",841,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/henry-ossawa-tanner/the-banjo-lesson-1893.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Ruscha used the scheme for nearly five decades: from early examples in the 1980s such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/not-a-bad-world-is-it-1984][i]Not A Bad World, Is It?[/i][/url] (1984) up to recent paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/wall-rocket-2013][i]Wall Rocket[/i][/url] (2013) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/tulsa-slut-2016][i]Tulsa Slut[/i][/url] (2016). 

[i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] depicts snow-covered mountaintops against a yellow sky, that signifies a sunset or a sunrise. For paintings like [i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] the artist usually appropriated landscapes from postcard images of different mountain ranges. The process of creating the painting began with a thin layer of paint sprayed onto the canvas. Later, the artist worked on the landscape in acrylic paint, and finally applied the lettering by using stencils. The font, named [i]Boy Scout Utility Modern[/i], was designed by Ruscha in the 1980s. The artist described it as a ‘no style’ typeface, and he has used it in many of his subsequent works.

When describing the concept behind painting, Ruscha stated: [i]‘It’s not a celebration of nature. I’m not trying to show beauty. It’s more like I’m painting ideas of ideas of mountains. The concept came to me as a logical extension of the landscapes that I’ve been painting for a while – horizontal landscapes, flatlands, the landscape I grew up in. Mountains like this were only ever a dream to me; they meant Canada or Colorado’[/i]. In other words, Ruscha purposefully chose to paint the landscape in an impersonal and detached manner from distant images found on souvenirs. Combined with the text ‘Pay Nothing Until April’, the painting is reminiscent of a poster in the window or an advertising for a bargain ski holiday. In particular, the text is similar to the advertising slogan formula ‘Buy Now, Pay Nothing until April’. Advertising and consumer culture are consistent themes in Ruscha’s art. [i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] continues this exploration by mimicking the aesthetic of mass produced culture.

Another important element in Ruscha’s art is his living and working environment, the city of Los Angeles. In particular, Los Angeles as the center of the entertainment industry has played a significant role in Ruscha’s work in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/large-trademark-with-eight-spotlights-1962][i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i][/url] (1962) and his photo book, [i]Every Building on the Sunset Strip[/i] (1966).  The mountain peaks of [i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] can be linked to visual images from adventure movies such as the James Bond film [i]On Her Majesty’s Secret Service[/i] (1969). Another possible inspiration was the logo of Paramount Pictures, one of Hollywood’s largest production companies. Through these associations to consumerist imagery and culture, the artist removed the mystique and sublime qualities of the natural landscape. Unlike the sublime landscapes of the 19th century European [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism#!#resultType:masonry]Romantic[/url] painters, that celebrated the power and greatness of nature, Ruscha’s painting embraces the banality of consumerist culture by covering the landscape with an advertising slogan. This is also a reflection of Los Angeles, a place Ruscha called ‘the ultimate cardboard town’.",1202,https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/edward-ruscha/pay-nothing-until-april-2003.jpg!HD.jpg,1200

Sheeler's experience as a photographer influenced his Precisionist style of painting, in which he emphasized the geometric shapes of objects in a hard-edged, clearly lit manner. For Sheeler, these monumental, streamlined forms signified human ingenuity in harnessing nature's power. His interpretation of American industry was somewhat idealized: workers are never shown, and the machinery is pristine and gleaming, free of any dirt or smoke. Sheeler expressed his feelings about the emotional symbolism of technology when he wrote: ""Every age manifests itself by some external evidence. In a period such as ours when only a comparatively few individuals seem to be given to religion, some form other than the Gothic cathedral must be found. Industry concerns the greatest numbers—it may be true, as has been said, that our factories are our substitute for religious expression"" (quoted in Constance Rourke, Charles Sheeler: Artist in the American Tradition, 1938).",650,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/charles-sheeler/water-1945.jpg,538

This painting depicts Ned Kelly's trial, where Kelly is depicted in handcuffs. A judge and several people look at him in the court. The painting is one of a number by Nolan to use enamel paint, usually Ripolin, a commercial paint not intended for art (and nothing to do with true vitreous enamel).

Nolan painted the picture at Heide at Bulleen, Victoria, the home of John Reed and his wife, Sunday Reed, who may have helped paint the floor of this painting. She supported Nolan while he painted the Kelly series. This painting is currently in the National Gallery of Australia. The painting was donated by Sunday Reed. Nolan had left the painting among many others at Heide. Although Nolan once wrote to Sunday Reed to tell her to take what she wanted, he subsequently demanded all his works back. Sunday Reed returned 284 other paintings and drawings to Nolan, but she refused to give up the 27 remaining Kellys, partly because she saw the works as fundamental to the proposed Heide Museum of Modern Art. Eventually, she gave them to the National Gallery of Australia in 1977 and this resolved the dispute.

In 1973, Nolan reproduced The Trial on a woven wool tapestry, which was lent to Admiralty House in Kirribilli, the official Sydney residence of the Governor-General of Australia. The tapestry was Sir John Kerr's favourite backdrop when making televised addresses. It is now located at the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney",600,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/sidney-nolan/the-trial-1947.jpg,449

The artist’s “Owl” was flagged as part of the “Black Painting Exhibition” held at China’s National Art Gallery in Beijing, as an example of being counterrevolutionary. The Gang of Four interpreted the winking owl as the artist’s portrayal of public officials turning a blind eye to wrong doings. For this, Huang Yongyu was harshly reprimanded for three and a half years laboring at a reform camp.

Joan Lebold Cohen, art historian, photographer and curator, and associate of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard, comments in her book, The New Chinese Painting 1949-1986 (1987), that: “[o]bviously, the verisimilitude to nature was ignored – owls often close one eye – but the entire Black Paintings concept was like Alice in Wonderland nonsense.” Pg. 125

Similarly, Eugene Wang, assistant art professor at Harvard University, wrote in his publication, The Winking Owl: Visual Effect and Its Art Historical Thick Description” Critical Inquiry 26 (Spring 2000), “There is a consensus now that the painter was a victim more sinned against than sinning, that he became an innocent pawn in a game of high-level power politics, and that the inquisition to which the painter and his painting were subjected made a travesty of art criticism. It is not clear, however, how innocent the painting was. Does the painting contain the message it was charged with?” Pg. 438

Mr. Wang does ask an interesting question though. While clearly overblown, was the artist in fact, entirely innocent of the charges? According to Laing’s publication, The Winking Owl: Art in the People’s Republic of China (1988), the author wrote: “Huang Yongyu had earlier (1962) gotten into trouble for his “counterrevolutionary” Animal Crackers poems in which he used animals to lampoon political figures.” Pg. 86 ",500,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/huang-yongyu/owl-1973.jpg,351

There are numerous replicas of the work by other Renaissance painters, and Leonardo's own preliminary sketch of Madonna's head in the Louvre. The Child's awkward posture, however, led some scholars to attribute parts of the painting to Leonardo's pupil Boltraffio. Other clues that contribute to the fact that Leonardo had this painting completed by one of his pupils include the harsh outlines of the Madonna and Child, as well as the plain landscape.

This work was painted sometime in the 1480s for the Visconti rulers of Milan and soon passed to the Litta family, in whose possession it would remain for centuries. In 1865, Alexander II of Russia acquired it from Count Litta, quondam minister to St Petersburg, and deposited the painting in the Hermitage Museum, where it has been exhibited to this day. The museum had the painting transferred from wood to canvas. The painting was briefly featured in the 2006 film The Da Vinci Code.",803,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/giovanni-antonio-boltraffio/madonna-litta-1490.jpg,1024

Working on the floor, Downing drew the circles freehand, without a compass, and used fast-drying Liquitex thinned with turpentine to soak the pigment onto the canvas. Slight spatial differences between the motifs and the occasional drip of pigment are the sole evidence of the artist’s handwork. Raw canvas played a substantive role in Downing’s color fields as it “kept light and air in the color no matter how dense or intense.” The artist’s dot paintings have been praised for their optical effects—the dots appear to advance and recede— and for their spiritual and symbolic qualities, based in the elemental form of the circle. However rich its associations, Red also embodies the openness and clarity that critic Clement Greenberg promoted in his theoretical writing, though it does so with a light-hearted tone, thanks to the upbeat palette that audaciously includes pink. Classified as Hard-Edge, Minimal or Op, Downing’s paintings are some of the more dazzling images of the sixties.",580,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/thomas-downing/red-1966.jpg,585

Saint Mary Magdalene, one of Christ’s followers, was the first to see him after his Resurrection. She lived a life of sin (being a prostituted woman), and at the end of her life, she spent some 30 years living as a solitary penitent in the wilderness. Donatello’s statue describes Saint Mary Magdalene during this stage, living a life of penance: her body is emaciated from fasting, and she has covered herself with her long hair. Though her figure is battered, her position and expression display not only regret but also survival and perseverance. Even in earlier sculptures such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/zuccone-statue-of-the-prophet-habakkuk-1425][i]Zuccone (Statue of the Prophet Habakkuk)[/i][/url] (1425) and the wooden [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/st-john-the-baptist-1438][i]Saint John the Baptist[/i][/url] (1438), Donatello’s expressive style successfully captured the emotional turmoil of his subjects. However, in his late manner of the 1450s, Donatello amplified the expressive qualities of his art, as is evident in [i]Magdalene Penitent[/i] and the bronze [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/statue-of-st-john-the-baptist-in-the-duomo-di-siena][i]Saint John the Baptist[/i][/url] (1457).  

Many details about [i]Magdalene Penitent[/i] remain unknown: the precise date of creation, the original location, and the patrons. Documentation shows that the statue was in the Baptistery of Florence as early as 1500, where it remained until 1966 when it was swept away during the flood of the Arno River in Florence. After the statue was recovered and restored, it was moved to its present location, the Museo dell’ Opera del Duomo in Florence. The restoration process revealed the original polychrome and gilding of the wooden statue. 

There are numerous examples of Mary Magdalene as a penitent in Florentine art before Donatello’s [i]Magdalene Penitent[/i]. One possible source for Donatello’s prototype is a panel painted by a late 13th-century master at the Accademia in Florence. The panel consists of a central image of Mary Magdalene, surrounded by eight different scenes from her life. She holds an inscription which states that those who sinned should not despair and return to God by following her example. Donatello’s statue belongs to a subgroup of five 15th century wooden statues that depict the subject of Magdalene as a penitent. In all cases, the statue is approximately a life-size figure of Magdalena covered by her long hair, usually holding her hands together as a sign of prayer. The earliest of these is in Pescia: the statue shows Magdalene in a calm state with a peaceful expression. Donatello remodeled this prototype - his expressive sculpture highlighted the physical and mental agony of her condition but also her strength and resolve to pursue penance. Donatello’s depiction of Magdalene influenced later works in both painting and sculpture. Some notable examples include [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/desiderio-da-settignano]Desiderio da Settignano[/url]’s wooden statue [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/desiderio-da-settignano/penitent-magdalene-1455][i]Petinent Magdalene[/i][/url] (ca.1455), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/filippino-lippi]Filippino Lippi[/url]’s panel [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/filippino-lippi/mary-magdalene-1500][i]Mary Magdalene[/i][/url] (ca. 1500), and the figure of Mary Magdalene in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli]Botticelli[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/trinity][i]Trinity[/i][/url] (ca. 1491-1493).",768,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/donatello/magdalene-penitent.jpg,1024

In the installation, the numbers from one through nine are represented by configurations of pebbles inferred from mathematical principles and connected by chalk lines. The drawing echoes the installation, with black circles on white paper. The third generation of this Conceptual work is the print, with a deep black aquatint surface that does not include connective lines. Its impact is of a more indeterminate and mysterious nature than its predecessors, obscuring the artist's basis in logic and certainty. In fact, the subject of all these works is not the specific mathematical principles from which they were derived, but rather the relationships between things and the process of perceiving these relationships.

The painting was completed in 1820, and hangs in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, D. C.

The painting depicts the surrender of British Major General Charles, Earl Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia on October 19, 1781, ending the Siege of Yorktown, and virtually guaranteeing American independence. Included in the depiction are many leaders of the American troops that took part in the siege.

The artist spent the early part of the American Revolutionary War as a soldier, serving as an aide to both George Washington and Horatio Gates. After resigning from the army in 1777, he pursued a career as an artist. In 1785 he began sketching out ideas for a series of large-scale paintings to commemorate the major events of the American Revolution. After spending a time in England, he returned to New York City in 1789, where he sketched a number of dignitaries whose portraits he intended to use in these paintings. In 1791 he traveled to Yorktown, Virginia, where he sketched the landscape of the surrender site.

Upon his return from Britain after the end of the War of 1812, he promoted this idea to the United States Congress. On the strength of his application and the successful exhibition of Battle of Bunker's Hill, Death of Montgomery, as well as studies for other proposed paintings, the Congress in 1817 voted to commission four large paintings from him, to be hung in the United States Capitol rotunda.

The price was set at $8,000 per painting, with the size and subject matter to be determined by President James Madison. A size of twelve by eighteen feet (370 cm × 550 cm) was agreed, as was the subject matter for the four paintings: the Declaration of Independence, the Surrender of General Burgoyne, the Surrender of Lord Cornwallis, and Washington Resigning his Commission. Trumbull spent the next eight years executing the commission, completing this painting in 1820. It was displayed in New York City, Boston, and Baltimore before coming to Washington, D. C., and Trumbull supervised its hanging in the Capitol rotunda in late 1820. It has remained there ever since. Trumbull himself cleaned and varnished the painting in 1828, and it has been periodically maintained since. In 1971, damage from a penny that was thrown hard enough to pierce the canvas was repaired. All of the Rotunda paintings were most recently cleaned in 2008.

The subject of this painting is the surrender of the British army at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, which ended the last major campaign of the Revolutionary War. The blue sky filled with dark clouds and the broken cannon suggest the battles that led to this event. In early September, entrenched with a force of 7,000 men, Cornwallis had hoped for rescue from the sea, but the British vessels were repelled by a French fleet. Within weeks General Washington had deployed a much larger army, and his artillery bombarded the British positions in early October. After American and French troops overran two British strongholds, Cornwallis surrendered on October 19.

In the center of the scene, American General Benjamin Lincoln appears mounted on a white horse. He extends his right hand toward the sword carried by the surrendering British officer, who heads the long line of troops that extends into the background. To the left, French officers appear standing and mounted beneath the white banner of the royal Bourbon family. On the right are American officers beneath the Stars and Stripes; among them are the Marquis de Lafayette and Colonel Jonathan Trumbull, the brother of the painter. General George Washington, riding a brown horse, stayed in the background because Lord Cornwallis himself was not present for the surrender.",1280,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/john-trumbull/the-surrender-of-lord-cornwallis-1820.jpg,844

He seems to have had an instinctive ability to simplify and compose works that have a strong structural quality, while at the same time managing to express the mood with his unique use of a harmonious blend of strong, almost primary, colours.

Sekoto’s subject matter was essentially the surrounding milieu in which he found himself. However, one of the outstanding features of Sekoto’s early work was the endless variety within this subject matter. The artist tackled subjects ranging from women gossiping and washday, to African beer halls and workers commuting. He appreciated the colourful, the anecdotal, the interesting, in what to more jaded eyes might have appeared commonplace and not worthy of an artist’s attention. Sekoto consistently imbued the figures in his compositions with great dignity and reveals his deep empathy with the human condition.
Lesley Spiro, Gerard Sekoto: Unsevered Ties, Johannesburg Art Gallery, 1989, p 42

By means of his work during the Sophiatown period, Sekoto was able to provide a window through which the closeted suburban society of Johannesburg could see and experience how other people lived. For some, the street scenes, the places of intimacy in township homes, the social habits of women on washday, children playing in the street, depicted in watercolours, poster paint and oils during Sekoto’s Sophiatown years, were an eye opener. A significant majority of those who bought his work were individuals who believed in racial equality, held liberal views and knew a great deal more about life across the colour line than most other white people.

It is located northeast of the city of Flagstaff in northern Arizona, United States. The artist James Turrell, for his land art project, acquired the 400,000-year-old, 3-mile-wide (4.8 km) crater's land. Turrell has since been transforming the inner cone of the crater into a massive naked-eye observatory, designed specifically for the viewing and experiencing sky-light, solar, and celestial phenomena. The fleeting Winter and Summer solstice events will be highlighted. The Dia Art Foundation is continuing to advocate for the development of James Turrell's Roden Crater project in the Painted Desert in Arizona which was begun in the 1970s with Dia's support. James Turrell, who purchased the Roden Crater in 1979, had plans to open the crater for public viewing in 2011.",1440,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00210/images/james-turrell/rodencrater-p1-2-1.jpg,588

In the fall of 1908, after years of constant travel and lengthy stays abroad, both had moved into a shared apartment on Ainmillerstrasse in Munich. Shortly before, they had visited Murnau for the first time and soon afterwards returned there for a joint study visit with Alexej Jawlensky and Marianne von Werefkin.

A diary entry by Münter from 1911 clearly reflects the feeling of liberation from years of artistic searching and the enthusiasm for a new beginning: ""We had seen Murnau on an excursion and recommended it to Jawlensky and Werefkin - who also called us there in the autumn. We lived in the Griesbräu and we liked it very much. After a short period of torment I made a big leap - from copying nature - more or less impressionistic - to feeling a content, to abstracting - to giving an extract.""

The small oil study by Jawlensky and Werefkin, which shows the painter couple lying down in a meadow, was created during a joint stay in Murnau in July 1909. It impressively demonstrates the change in Münter's work, the suddenly bold, uncompromising independence and the emphasis on reduced outline drawing compared to her previous painting studies based on nature, which were based on the tradition of late Impressionism. Radical simplification of form and clear, strong color contrasts characterize the picture. The figures are inserted into the dense, homogeneous green of the meadow slope and the equally dense blue of the sky and the mountains as simple basic forms, the faces barely indicated.

All the important elements are succinctly and accurately set in bold black contours using the Cloisonnism technique, which Alexej Jawlensky, who ultimately came from Paul Gauguin, had taught her. During this time, Münter maintained particularly close artistic contacts with Jawlensky in particular and, above all, incorporated his suggestions for a ""synthesis"" of the picture - a ""consolidation"" of the elements into a few characteristic forms - in her direct view of things, freed from everything irrelevant. In the first years in Murnau, Münter created a large number of important pictures with a new enthusiasm for work, which are an essential artistic contribution to the later movement of the 'Blauer Reiter'.

The sculpture portrays the Renaissance condottiere Erasmo da Narni, known as ‘Gattamelata.’ He mostly served for the Republic of Venice, leading Venetian troops to victory in the Milanese wars. The statue was commissioned in Padua, which was at the time under Venetian rule.

The statue invites apparent comparisons to the [i]Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius[/i] (175AD) in Rome. Another clear reference is to the [i]Roman bronze Horses of Saint Mark[/i] installed at the façade of the St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice. The two references to ancient sculptures demonstrate the visual and conceptual influence of classical antiquity on Donatello’s [i]Gattamelata[/i]. The careful study of classical art is evident in the attention devoted to the horse’s musculature as well as the realistic depiction of the warrior. By referencing equestrian imperial statues, Donatello attributed grandeur, power, and authority to the military leader. Gattamelata is depicted as a great emperor from classical times;  his stance is powerful and assured, while his expression is severe and intense.

When analyzing the details of the statue, one becomes aware of the extent of Donatello’s interest and broad knowledge of classical art and antiquity. For instance, Donatello decorated the back of Gattamelata’s saddle with two small horse riders that are similar to the nude riders from the interior west and north friezes of the Parthenon. Even though Donatello modeled the small figures quite freely, he depicted them in detail: the riders, set against a backdrop of a decorative plant ornament, are mounted on horses wearing short capes, and one of them carries a flame. However, these meticulous and elegant details are not visible to the viewer that observes the statue at the Piazza del Santo. The careful planning and artistic virtuosity demonstrated in these details show the importance and grandeur of the project. Donatello may have used these spaces to express his artistic mastery and his interest in the revival of antiquity. He illuminated Gattamelata’s armor with motifs of angels and [i]Erotes[/i] - winged gods associated with love and sex in Greek mythology. This imaginative armor is very different from the practical suit of armor worn in the Arsenal of Venice. In a lower relief, motifs of festive [i]putti[/i] echo the elements seen in the armor. The breastplate of Gattamelata’s [i]lorica[/i] shows the head of Medusa, a symbol frequently found on Roman military statues.

Donatello’s [i]Equestrian statue of Gattamelata[/i] became a model for future equestrian sculptures. One of the most notable examples is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio/equestrian-statue-of-bartolomeo-colleoni][i]Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni[/i][/url] (1480-1488) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio]Andrea del Verrocchio[/url] in Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice. It was the second major equestrian monument of the Italian Renaissance created after Donatello’s [i]Gattamelata[/i]. Like Gattamelata, Bartolomeo Colleoni was a military leader, and Donatello’s conception proved to be a precedent for sculptures honoring military heroes.",628,https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00186/images/donatello/gattamelata.jpg,850

Is this stack of papers on the floor meant to be walked around and viewed from different angles, like sculpture? Or did the artist intend these papers to be picked up and examined? Listed on the sheets are the names of 460 individuals killed by gunshot during the week of May 1–7, 1989, cited by name, age, city, and state, with a brief description of the circumstances of their deaths, and, in most cases, a photographic image of the deceased. These images and words, appropriated from Time magazine, where they first appeared, reflect González-Torres's interest in gun control.
Conceptually, Death by Gun is an ongoing work of art. Viewer participation is an important element, and the public is encouraged to read the sheets and take them away to keep, display, or give to others. While González-Torres determined that the stack is ""ideally"" nine inches high, he arranged for the depleted sheets to be continually reprinted and replaced, thus insuring that Death by Gun can be distributed indefinitely. From its beginnings, printed art has been made in multiple copies for dissemination to a wide audience. Here that idea is expanded with an edition that is ""endless.""
Deborah Wye, Artists and Prints: Masterworks from The Museum of Modern Art, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 2004, p. 245
Printed art by Félix González-Torres stands in bold contrast to the etchings, woodcuts, lithographs, and screenprints that make up the traditional history of modern print-making. González-Torres did not pursue this medium for the expressive possibilities inherent in its various techniques but, instead, chose it for its ability to function within his broader conceptual practice. The commercial offset process (photolithography) offered him a vehicle that was easy and inexpensive to produce, and also endlessly replicable. The fact that its surfaces maintained the detached, second-generation appearance of his often grainy photographic sources was a feature that suited his message of ephemerality rather than permanence.
Stacks of printed paper, in the form of sculptural objects with Minimalist overtones, constitute a major component of González-Torres's work, which also encompasses such projects as installations of wrapped candy, hanging cords of lightbulbs, and beaded curtains. His printed art extended as well to billboards, give-away booklets, and newspaper inserts, often incorporating his own or found photographs. A gentle, poetic mood emanates from much of this art, suggesting poignant memories or provoking thoughtful consideration of social issues.
While González-Torres dealt with gay rights, AIDS, and a variety of governmental abuses in his own work and as a member of the collective Group Material, the subject of ""Untitled"" (Death by Gun), and its treatment, is unusually specific for him. Appropriating imagery from Time magazine, it presents 460 individuals killed by gunshot in one week in the United States, and includes the name, age, and circumstances of death for each person depicted. No opinion about gun control is added by the artist. Here an issue of public debate engages anyone who follows the artist's intention and takes away one of his sheets. Dissemination, an age-old function of printed art, is ongoing since ""Untitled"" (Death by Gun) is reprinted as the stack is depleted.",500,https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/felix-gonzalez-torres/untitled-death-by-gun-1990.jpg,344

The painting shows a key point in Gibraltar's history when the Great Siege of Gibraltar was undertaken by the Spanish against the British at Gibraltar in November 1781. The Spanish officer Don Jose de Barboza is being given respect as he lies dying. Although left behind by his own retreating troops he still unsuccessfully attacked the British troops with chivalry.

The painting is based on a real attack that took place in Gibraltar on November 27, 1781. The Great Siege of Gibraltar was an unsuccessful attempt by Spain and France to capture Gibraltar from the British during the War of American Independence.

The painting depicts the events of the night of November 26, 1781 when British troops made a sudden attack (sortie), against the enemy batteries. The death of the Spanish officer Don Jose de Barboza is the focal point of the painting. He fell mortally wounded and died near his post refusing assistance after having been abandoned by his troops. He is portrayed as rejecting the aid of General George Elliott, commander of the British troops.

In 1782, the Siege was lifted and Trumbull's friend Antonio de Poggi, an artist and dealer based in London who had been in the besieged garrison, told him of an earlier incident, which had occurred in November 1781. This had all the ingredients he sought: “...the Heroism of the vanquished, the Humanity of the Victors - the darkness of night illuminating an extensive conflagration - the Hurry and Tumult of the troops busy in the work of destruction - the quiet & calm of the Officers, the guiding Spirits of the Scene.”

Trumbull labored on the composition, over many sketches and three large completed canvases. As the project progressed, Trumbull's ambitions for it to be his big breakthrough to major patronage grew too. He refused large offers for the picture, preferring to exhibit it privately for admission fees.

Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford had called the painting: “the finest picture [I] had ever seen painted on the northern side of the Alps.”

The painting is depicted on the back of the 2010 Gibraltar 10-pound note.",650,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/john-trumbull/the-sortie-made-by-the-garrison-of-gibraltar-1789.jpg,421
